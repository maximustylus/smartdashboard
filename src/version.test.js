/**
 * THE APP HAS EXACTLY ONE VERSION, AND NO FILE MAY TYPE IT OUT BY HAND.
 *
 * `CHANGELOG.md` has asserted since v1.6.0 that "single source of truth for the
 * app version is `package.json` `version`". Nothing enforced it. By v1.12.0 the
 * deployed site was rendering FOUR different answers at once:
 *
 *     package.json          1.12.0
 *     App.jsx               v1.41-OFFICIAL      (sandbox banner)
 *     WelcomeScreen.jsx     System v1.52        (landing footer)
 *     AdminPanel.jsx        System Database v1.4 (admin header)
 *
 * All three literals were stale, none agreed, and all three were visible to the
 * other departments being shown the app. Nothing would ever have updated them,
 * because nothing referenced them.
 *
 * A convention that lives only in a document is a convention that drifts. This
 * test is the enforcement: it fails the build if a hand-typed version string
 * reappears in code that renders.
 *
 * COMMENTS ARE EXEMPT, DELIBERATELY. This codebase annotates changes with the
 * release that made them ("shipped v1.9.0", "audit M6.1", "RFC 5545 §3.3.11"),
 * which is valuable history and must stay writable. So the scan strips comments
 * first and only inspects code. That is also the honest limit of this test: it
 * cannot catch a version typed into a comment, and it is not trying to.
