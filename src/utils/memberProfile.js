/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * MEMBER PROFILE — the two fields a person sets about themselves, in two places
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * Grade and profession. Everything else on the Edit Profile screen — display name,
 * department/ward, bio, password, notification preference — lives on
 * `users/{uid}`, the person's own private record. These two do not, and they do
 * not live in the SAME place as each other either. Three documents, and each
 * boundary is forced by a rule rather than chosen:
 *
 *   users/{uid}                      allow get: if isSelf(userId)
 *       Only you can read it. So anything a colleague or the roster engine must
 *       see cannot be here — Nisa opening Configure would get permission-denied
 *       on every member.
 *
 *   teams/{teamId}/members/{uid}     allow get, list: if isMember(teamId)
 *       PROFESSION lives here. The whole team can read it, which is the point: a
 *       rehab team needs to see it has three physiotherapists and one
 *       occupational therapist. A profession is on somebody's badge and grants
 *       nothing.
 *
 *   teams/{teamId}/grades/{uid}      allow get: if isSelf(uid) || isLead(teamId)
 *       GRADE lives here, alone.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️ WHY GRADE NEEDED ITS OWN DOCUMENT: RULES CANNOT HIDE A FIELD
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The first version of this module put grade on the membership beside profession,
 * and that was wrong in a way that is easy to miss: Firestore grants access per
 * DOCUMENT. There is no field-level read. A member who may `get` the membership
 * reads every field on it — so a grade stored there is a grade every colleague in
 * the department can read, and no amount of hiding it in the UI changes that.
 *
 * Pay grade is the most sensitive thing somebody volunteers about themselves short
 * of the wellbeing log. "The roster needs it" justifies the roster reading it; it
 * does not extend to the team browsing it. So it is a document a colleague cannot
 * open, read by the person and by a lead — a lead because `generateRosterV2` runs
 * in their browser and `bandOfGrade` decides who may lead a shift, so a lead who
 * cannot read grades cannot roster at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE PROTECTION IS PARTIAL, WHICH IS WORTH STATING RATHER THAN IMPLYING.
 *    The engine gives lead shifts to the senior and principal bands, so a published
 *    roster still tells an attentive reader roughly which band somebody is in. What
 *    this withholds is the NUMBER — and the distance between "rosters as a senior"
 *    and "is an AH14" is most of what makes the number uncomfortable to have on
 *    display beside your name.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️ GRADE IS SELF-SET, AND THAT IS A DECISION WITH A COST
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `bandOfGrade` turns a grade into a band, and the band decides who may LEAD a
 * shift. So somebody who selects `AH15` starts receiving lead duties, and nothing
 * flags it — not a log, not a banner, not a review step. The owner chose this over
 * lead-set-only because the alternative makes a roster master chase twenty people
 * for a fact each of them knows about themselves.
 *
 * The mitigation is HONESTY AT THE POINT OF CHOOSING rather than a permission:
 * `describeGrade` returns the band and, in plain words, what it means for duties,
 * so somebody selecting a principal grade reads "leads shifts" beside it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SECOND HALF OF THAT MITIGATION DID NOT EXIST, AND THIS COMMENT USED TO
 *    CLAIM IT DID. It said a lead "sees every grade in the Configure staff table
 *    and can correct it there". A lead does see them — `useTeamGrades` feeds
 *    `staffRowsFromMembers` — but those rows are DERIVED and read-only, so there
 *    was no correction path anywhere in the app. Nobody but the person themselves
 *    could set a grade, which also meant a department could not start rostering
 *    until every member had been chased for one: the exact cost the self-set
 *    decision was taken to avoid.
 *
 *    A lead now sets and corrects both fields from the TEAM tab
 *    (`TeamMembersPanel`), one member at a time. `firestore.rules` already allowed
 *    it — `allow create, update: if isSelf(memberUid) || isLead(teamId)` — so this
 *    was a missing screen rather than a missing permission.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A GRADE SOMEBODY ELSE SET IS RECORDED AS SUCH, in `setBy`. Not WHO set it
 *    — a named log of who changed a colleague's pay grade is a second sensitive
 *    artefact, and the reason this document carries no history. Just `'self'` or
 *    `'lead'`, which is enough for the profile screen to tell somebody why a grade
 *    they never chose is deciding which shifts they lead.
