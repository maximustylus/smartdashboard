/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * CLINICAL ANSWER PARSER — `AC5`: exported, imported, and finally unit-testable
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * This lived inside `AuraChat.jsx` as a module-level `const` that was never
 * exported — so the four test files that name `AuraChat` all read the FILE AS
 * TEXT and asserted on regexes, because importing the component drags in jsPDF
 * and html2canvas. Source scanning proves a string is present; it cannot prove
 * a number is right, which is `AC5` and is how `AC1`, `AC2` and `AC15` survived
 * inside eleven untested lines for weeks.
 *
 * Everything word-level lives in `clinicalFlags.js` (tested); everything
 * postal lives in `postalSectors.js` (tested). This module is the ASSEMBLY —
 * which raw answer feeds which parser, and what the result object is called —
 * and now the assembly is testable too. The body moved VERBATIM from
 * `AuraChat.jsx`; the annotations moved with it because they are about these
 * lines, not about the chat.

   * ⚠️ THE LADDER MOVED TO `clinicalFlags.js` AND IS NOW TESTED — `AC1` `AC2` `AC15`.
   *
   * It lived here, inside a module-level `const` that is not exported, so it could
   * not be unit-tested without a React tree. `COMMUNITY_TODO.md` P4.3 has had
   * "`parseClinicalData` has no tests" OPEN for weeks, and three defects sat in
   * these eleven lines the whole time:
   *
   *   AC1   `includes('20')` ate every three-digit answer containing "20", so a
   *         typed "120 minutes" scored 15 and a five-day two-hour exerciser was
   *         recorded at 75 min/wk and routed to a BEGINNER programme.
   *   AC2   the digit fallback meant "daily" scored 0 days and "about an hour"
   *         scored 0 minutes — CP1's defect, one layer upstream.
   *   AC15  `includes('60 min')` was tested FIRST, and "45–60 mins" contains it,
   *         so that tapped chip scored 65 where the form's table says 52.
   *
   * The parsers are pure, exported and asserted against `ConventionalForm`'s own
   * midpoint tables, so the two pathways cannot drift while they remain separate.
