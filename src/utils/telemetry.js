/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * COMMUNITY TELEMETRY — the public portal's only write
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * Records one completed public health screening. The person writing it has no
 * account, has not signed in, and — until they reach the result page — has not been
 * shown anything about what is kept.
 *
 * ── WHY `clientReference` IS GONE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This function used to attach `clientReference: navigator.userAgent` to every
 * record. `ResultPage.jsx` tells the public, in the "Data Governance and Privacy"
 * panel, that:
 *
 *     "All data collected through the NEXUS AURA system is de-identified at the
 *      point of capture … not linked to any identifiable personal information."
 *
 * A full user-agent string is a well-known browser-fingerprinting vector. Beside
 * the postal sector, age band, gender, RACE and housing type these records already
 * carry, it made that sentence untrue — and the panel is rendered on the RESULT
 * page, which is reached AFTER `recordTelemetry` has already run, so it was never
 * consent in the first place; it was a claim made after the fact.
 *
 * Nothing read the field. Grepping `clientReference` across the repository found
 * the write and nothing else. So it bought no debugging and cost the accuracy of a
 * privacy statement shown to members of the public about their own health data.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS STILL STORED IS NOT NOTHING, and removing one field did not make this
 *    anonymous. Sector + age band + gender + race + housing type remains a
 *    quasi-identifier set in a population this size. Making the notice true, rather
 *    than making the data match the notice, is the larger piece of work — it is
 *    written up in the community post-mortem and is not done here.
 *
 * ── FAILING SILENTLY IS DELIBERATE, AND IS ALSO A PROBLEM ────────────────────
 *
 * The catch swallows. A member of the public who has just spent four minutes on a
 * health assessment must still reach their result if the write fails, so throwing
 * here would be worse. But it means a rules change, an outage or a quota breach
 * produces NO signal anywhere — the pathway looks healthy and records nothing.
 * `firestore.rules` has a matching note; a denied write here is invisible by design.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ AND A CATCH DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST A HANG. THIS IS THE `CP24` FIX. ──
 *
 * The promise above was AWAITED by both pathways before they navigated the person
 * to their result. A `catch` protects against `addDoc` REJECTING. `addDoc` does not
 * reject when the backend is unreachable — the Firestore SDK queues the write
 * locally and retries, and the promise simply never settles.
 *
 * So the protection this header described did not exist. Measured in headless
 * Chromium with `firestore.googleapis.com` blocked: the chat asked every question,
 * reached "Generating your personalised plan now…", and was STILL THERE 45 SECONDS
 * LATER. The form is the same construct, and its `finally { setBusy(false) }` never
 * ran either, so Submit stayed on "Processing…" — the state that file's own `FIX 4`
 * claims to have fixed. An ad blocker, a corporate network or patchy mobile data is
 * enough to produce it.
 *
 * `WRITE_DEADLINE_MS` is the fix, and it is here rather than at the two call sites
 * deliberately: a caller that forgets to bound this re-creates the defect, and
 * there will be more callers. The write is NOT cancelled when the deadline passes —
 * it stays queued in the SDK and flushes if connectivity returns, which within a
 * single-page app usually means it still lands. What is bounded is how long a
 * person waits to be told about their own health.

/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * ⚠️ FIELDS THAT MUST NEVER REACH FIRESTORE, STRIPPED HERE RATHER THAN AT EACH CALL
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * The record this module writes already carries postal sector, age BAND, sex,
 * ethnicity and housing type. That combination is close enough to identifying
 * already; adding a whole-year age, or a grip figure in kilograms, closes the gap
 * for anybody who ran the session at which the measurement was taken.
 *
 * Both are computed and both belong on screen, in the resident's own report, on the
 * resident's own device. Neither belongs in an aggregate.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE STRIP HAPPENS INSIDE THIS FUNCTION ON PURPOSE. The obvious place is the
 *    call site, and that is exactly where it fails: `AuraChat` passes the WHOLE
 *    parsed object as `payload`, so every field anything ever adds to
 *    `parseClinicalData` ships by default, and it ships silently. `ageYears` did
 *    precisely that the day it was added, and nobody would have seen it. Enforcing
 *    it here means a caller cannot leak these by forgetting, because there is
 *    nothing for a caller to remember.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SOURCE ALLOWLIST IS STILL THE PRIMARY GUARD. `toStorableMeasurements`
 *    builds the band record from named fields rather than by deletion. This is the
 *    second line, for the payloads that are whole objects rather than built ones.
