/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * CLINICAL FLAGS — matching a person's own words, without matching inside them
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * The chat pathway derives every clinical and SDOH flag by running fixed
 * multilingual regexes over the raw text a respondent typed or tapped
 * (`AuraChat.jsx`, `parseClinicalData`). Those flags feed `calculateRiskScore` and
 * `selectCTA`, so a false match is not cosmetic: it changes which tier a member of
 * the public is routed to.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS WRONG ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every term was an UNANCHORED substring. `/low/` is the clearest case — it sits
 * inside "slowly", "follow", "allow" and "below" — so
 *
 *     "I walk slowly but I feel great"
 *
 * was flagged as psychological distress and routed to the WELLBEING tier, which
 * sends the person to their polyclinic's mental health service. "I follow a
 * routine" and "I allow myself rest days" did the same. `heart` matched inside
 * "heartfelt", `cost` inside "costume", `alone` inside a surname.
 *
 * Worse, and separately: `previous_id` was tested with the same style of pattern,
 * so a returning respondent whose assessment ID happened to contain the letters
 * "no" — `NX-XKNO4J2` — had it silently discarded and their record linkage lost.
 * Base-36 uppercase IDs contain "NO" often enough for that to be a real rate.
 *
 * ── WHY THE MATCHING IS SPLIT BY SCRIPT ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ `\b` IS AN ASCII WORD BOUNDARY AND DOES NOT WORK FOR THE OTHER THREE
 *    LANGUAGES. In JavaScript regex, `\b` is a position between `\w` and non-`\w`,
 *    and `\w` is `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. Chinese and Tamil characters are not `\w`, so
 *    `\b压抑\b` asserts boundaries that are never both true and the term silently
 *    stops matching — which would fail exactly one way: a Chinese or Tamil speaker
 *    reporting distress, and no flag raised.
 *
 *    So Latin terms are word-bounded and non-Latin terms are matched as plain
 *    substrings. That is correct rather than a compromise: the false-positive
 *    problem is a property of alphabetic scripts sharing letter sequences, and
 *    these ideographic and abugida terms do not have it.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ NEGATION: WHY THIS FILE CHANGED ITS MIND — `CP22` ─────────────────────
 *
 * This header used to say negation was deliberately NOT handled, and the argument
 * was a good one: "I do not get chest pain" setting `symptomFlag` is a false
 * positive in the SAFE direction, and teaching a regex to read negation risks
 * turning a safe over-triage into an under-triage on the one absolute
 * contraindication in the model.
 *
 * Two things changed it.
 *
 * FIRST, THE RATE. A pre-merge stress run measured 16 of 22 realistic typed answers
 * setting a flag the answer had just denied — across every matcher, in every
 * language. Not an edge case: the ordinary way people answer a question in prose.
 *
 * SECOND, AND DECISIVELY, WHERE THOSE FLAGS GO NOW. When the argument above was
 * written, an over-triage cost the person a nudge toward a GP. It no longer stops
 * there. The flags are printed on the HANDOVER SLIP — a sheet of paper the person
 * carries to an Active Ageing Centre or a Social Service Office, which states
 * "Chest pain or dizziness on exertion" as something they reported. A tool that
 * prints a denial as a positive finding, to a third party, is not erring on the
 * side of caution; it is putting words in somebody's mouth. The same counts also
 * reach the population rollup a health system plans from.
 *
 * ⚠️ SO THE OLD ARGUMENT IS HONOURED IN THE SHAPE OF THE FIX, NOT DISCARDED.
 *    Suppression is DELIBERATELY TIMID and every rule below exists to keep it that
 *    way: the cue must sit in the same clause, immediately before the term (or
 *    immediately after it in Tamil, where negation is postfix), within a short
 *    window. Any conjunction, comma or full stop between them and the flag STAYS.
 *    "no chest pain and dizziness" still flags — the second symptom is not clearly
 *    covered by the first denial, and when it is ambiguous the flag survives.
 *    Over-triage remains the direction this fails in.

 * a weekly minutes figure. PAVS alone can route a 75-year-old to "150 minutes a
 * week" without ever asking whether they have fallen.
 *
 * ⚠️ ORDER MATTERS AND IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. "No falls" CONTAINS the word
 *    "fall", so a naive matcher reads the safest answer as the riskiest one. The
 *    negative is therefore tested FIRST and returns immediately.
 *
 * `avoidsActivity` is kept separate from the count because fear of falling is its
 * own clinical signal: somebody who has fallen once and now avoids the stairs is

 * ⚠️ THESE TERM LISTS ARE COUPLED TO THE CHIP TEXT IN ALL FOUR LANGUAGES, AND

 *    ms/zh/ta and the flag stayed unknown — a missing data point. Translating the
 *    chips makes the question appear; if these lists had stayed English, "Tiada
 *    jatuh" would have failed `matchesNoFalls` and fallen through to `falls = 1`.

/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * PAVS — days per week and minutes per session
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * The Physical Activity Vital Sign is `days × minutes`, and it is the single
 * measure the community portal exists to take. It sets the risk point, the tier
 * banner, the result copy and — through `selectCTA` — which programme somebody is
 * routed to.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS LIVES HERE, EXPORTED, BECAUSE IT USED TO LIVE INSIDE A COMPONENT AND
 *    THEREFORE HAD NO TESTS. `parseClinicalData` is a module-level `const` in
 *    `AuraChat.jsx` — not exported, unreachable without a React tree, and
 *    `COMMUNITY_TODO.md` P4.3 has had "`parseClinicalData` has no tests" `OPEN` for
 *    weeks. Four test files name `AuraChat`; none renders it. They read the file as
 *    TEXT and assert on regexes, for a documented reason (jsPDF, html2canvas) —
 *    and source scanning proves a string is present, not that a number is right.
 *    Both defects below were invisible to every one of them.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️ `AC1` — "120 minutes" WAS RECORDED AS 15
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The ladder ended `: minsStr.includes('less') || minsStr.includes('20') ? 15`.
 * An unanchored substring test, so every session length CONTAINING "20" — 120,
 * 200, 220, 1200 — collapsed to 15 minutes. Measured: somebody training five days
 * a week for two hours was recorded at **75 min/week**, charged the physical
 * activity deficit point, told they were below the 150 guideline, and routed to a
 * free six-session BEGINNER programme.
 *
 * `CP15`, `CP18`, `CP19` and `CP22` were all unanchored substring tests and all
 * closed. The hunt reached the clinical flag matchers, the previous-ID field, the
 * postal chips and typed symptom answers. It never reached this ladder — the
 * primary measure.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️ `AC2` — "daily" AND "about an hour" SCORED ZERO
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The fallback was `parseInt(match(/\d+/) || ['0'])` — no digit, no score. So
 * somebody who walks an hour every day and writes it the way people write it got
 * `pavsScore = 0`, the maximum inactivity reading the instrument can produce.
 * `"every day"` survived only by being one of three literal alternatives in the
 * days regex; `"daily"` was not on that list.
 *
 * That is `CP1` returning one layer upstream — an active person scored as
 * sedentary — and `CP26` had already built the fix pattern for exactly this shape
 * (`parseAgeBand` reads "sixty five" and "I am 72"). PAVS never got it.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* DONE HERE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `ConventionalForm` still uses its own `DAYS_MIDPOINT` / `MINS_MIDPOINT` lookup
 * tables. Unifying the two pathways on one parser is `AC3`/`AC5` and it is a larger
 * change than tonight allows. The chip midpoints below are copied from that table
 * **exactly**, and `pathwayParity`-style assertions in the test file hold them
 * equal, so the two cannot drift while they remain separate.
 */

/**
 * Chip midpoints, equal to `ConventionalForm.MINS_MIDPOINT` for all five chips.
 *
 * ⚠️ `AC15` — THE RANGES ARE TESTED BEFORE THE OPEN-ENDED CHIP, AND THE ORIGINAL
 *    LADDER HAD IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND. It began
 *    `includes('60+') || includes('60 min') ? 65`, and **`"45–60 mins"` contains
 *    the substring `"60 min"`** — so the `45–60` chip scored **65 instead of 52**,
 *    a 25% overstatement of session length on a TAPPED chip, in the pathway most
 *    people use.
 *
 *    That makes it the one input both pathways accept and disagree on. The
 *    post-mortem's `AC3` asserted they "agree exactly on all nine chip
 *    combinations — verified"; the probe behind that sentence tested four pairs
 *    and never included this chip. Found by a parity assertion written against the
 *    form's table rather than against remembered expectations.
 *
 *    The tier does not flip for any chip-days × chip-minutes pair — 1.5 days is
 *    below 150 either way, 3.5 and 6 are above either way — but `pavsScore` is
 *    recorded to `community_assessments` and shown to the person, and it was 25%
 *    high for everybody who tapped it.
 *
 * ⚠️ `60 min` IS NO LONGER A CHIP PATTERN AT ALL. A typed "60 minutes" now falls to
 *    the digit scan and yields **60**, which is what the person said. 65 is the
 *    midpoint of the OPEN-ENDED "60+" band and belongs only to that chip.
