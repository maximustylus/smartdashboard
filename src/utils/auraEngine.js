// --- 0. THE SHIFT DISPLAY STRING — ONE DEFINITION ----------------------------
//
// `staff` is a DERIVED DISPLAY STRING, not an identity. It stopped being an
// identity on 6 May 2026 (commit 2de3dde) and only three of its four consumers
// were reconciled (ROSTER_POSTMORTEM.md A-RC1). Every producer of that string —
// `generateRoster` below and the swap mutator in AuraPulseBot.jsx — now goes
// through this one function so the two cannot drift apart again.
//
// The exact format is load-bearing: `buildICS` puts it in a VEVENT SUMMARY (now
// RFC 5545-escaped on the way — audit M6) and RosterView renders it in the
// calendar cell.
//
// A shift with no co-lead (the pre-6-May legacy shape had only one person)
// yields `Lead: X` rather than `Lead: X, Co: undefined`.
export const buildShiftStaffLabel = (lead, coLead) => {
    const hasCoLead = typeof coLead === 'string' && coLead.trim() !== '';
    return hasCoLead ? `Lead: ${lead}, Co: ${coLead}` : `Lead: ${lead}`;
};

// --- 1. CORE LOGIC ---

// Helper: Rotate array by k steps (Cyclic Shift)
const rotate = (arr, k) => {
    const n = arr.length;
    const offset = k % n;
    return [...arr.slice(offset), ...arr.slice(0, offset)];
};

// --- 1a. DATE PRIMITIVES (ROSTER_TODO.md P4 — post-mortem B1/B2, audit M2) ---
//
// BOTH HALVES ARE LOCAL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
//
// Before P4 this engine parsed `startDate` with `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` — which
// V8 reads as UTC midnight — and then emitted keys with
// `toISOString().split('T')[0]`. Those two inconsistencies cancelled: local
// `setDate` arithmetic preserves the wall-clock time, so a constant UTC offset
// went in and came back out and every fixed-offset zone produced identical keys.
//
// Fixing only the OUTPUT half (the rev-1 remediation plan) breaks that
// cancellation and puts every key a day early west of Greenwich — measured,
// `TZ=America/New_York` -> `2026-01-31, 2026-02-01, …`. So the parse and the key
// derivation move together, or neither moves. See ROSTER_POSTMORTEM.md B2 rev2.
//
// The residual defect the cancellation could NOT hide is DST (ROSTER_QC_AUDIT.md
// M2): `setDate` on a live instant carries the wall-clock TIME across a
// spring-forward boundary, dragging the underlying instant over a UTC date line,
// so every week after the transition slid one day early (measured: start
// `2026-03-02` under `TZ=America/New_York` -> weeks 2-4 ran Sun-Thu). `addDays`
// below rebuilds the date from calendar PARTS instead, which asks the runtime
// for local midnight on a calendar day — the question a roster actually needs
// answered — and is therefore immune to the transition.
//
// `rosterEngineV2.js` has equivalents (`parseLocalDateKey`, `toLocalDateKey`,
// `snapToMonday`) and they are deliberately NOT imported here: V2 already
// imports `buildShiftStaffLabel` and `MAX_ROSTER_WEEKS` from this file, so
// importing back would make the two modules circular. Four lines each is cheaper
// than the cycle, and `auraEngine.test.js` pins that the two `snapToMonday`
// implementations agree so they cannot drift.

// three, and `AuraPulseBot` compared `staff` to a bare name — three files with
// three different ideas of what a shift is (ROSTER_POSTMORTEM.md A1/A2).
//
// SWAP SEMANTICS — MECHANICAL SUBSTITUTION (user decision, not inferred):
// the covering colleague takes over EXACTLY the role the requester held. Lead
// for lead, co-lead for co-lead. No promotion, and no third person's duty
// changes. `applyShiftSubstitution` is the only place that rule lives.
//
// SHAPE TOLERANCE: the live document may still hold pre-6-May shifts where
// `staff` was a bare identity and `lead`/`coLead` are absent. Whether it does is
// unknown and will not be established before the presentation
// (ROSTER_TODO.md "A1 live status: LIVE-VERIFY PENDING"), so every reader here
// handles both shapes, and a write upgrades a legacy shift to the modern one.

/**
 * WHOSE shift is being handed over, and which duty — decided at REQUEST time.
 *
 * This closes ROSTER_QC_AUDIT.md M11. `RosterView` used to write
 * `requestedBy: <the clicking user>` unconditionally, while `swapRole` came from
 * `shiftRoleOf(shift, <the clicking user>)`. For an admin acting on a shift they
 * do not hold — and the app's only admins are not in the roster staff pool at
 * all — that pair is `(<admin>, null)`: a request `planSwapApplication` is
 * guaranteed to refuse, because it searches that day for the admin's own name.
 *
 * The semantics, which are a decision and not a derivation:
 *
 *   • The acting user HOLDS the shift (lead or coLead) — they are asking for
 *     cover for themselves. `requestedBy` is them, `swapRole` is their own duty,
 *     and no `initiatedBy` is recorded. This is the pre-existing behaviour and
 *     is deliberately untouched. A `chosenRole` is IGNORED on this path: an
 *     admin who is on the shift is still swapping their own duty, not
 *     reassigning their colleague's.
 *
 *   • The acting user does NOT hold the shift but IS an admin — they are
 *     arranging cover ON BEHALF OF the clinician who does hold it. So
 *     `requestedBy` is that clinician (the person being swapped out, which is
 *     what the mutator matches on), `swapRole` is that clinician's duty, and
 *     `initiatedBy` records the admin so the ledger still says who arranged it.
 *
 *   • Anyone else — refused here, with a reason. `handleShiftClick` already
 *     prevents them from opening the modal; this is the second latch.
 *
 * `chosenRole` is only consulted when the shift has more than one assignable
 * duty. With exactly one there is no choice to make, so it is selected
 * automatically (`autoSelected: true`) and `chosenRole` is not consulted at all
 * — a legacy single-holder shift must not require the admin to pick `lead` out
 * of a list of one.
 *
 * Returns the full triple plus everything the modal needs to describe itself:
 * `{ ok, reason, requestedBy, swapRole, initiatedBy, onBehalf, holdsShift,
 * assignableRoles, autoSelected }`. `assignableRoles` is populated even on the
 * refusal paths, because the "pick a duty" refusal is exactly when the UI needs
 * the list in order to offer the choice.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Firestore. The triple it returns is the triple that later
 * reaches `planSwapApplication` as `{ requestedBy, swapRole }`.

// and only then does the roster move. Cardiology's roster master corrects the
// week INSIDE the week — somebody rings in sick at 07:40 and the 09:00 clinic
// needs a name on it now. That is a one-party act: the lead decides, and the
// roster moves. Until this section existed the only tool for it was a full
// regenerate, which rewrites every day of the run to change one.
//
// IT IS THE SAME MUTATION. `applyShiftSubstitution` is the only place the
// substitution rule lives and it is reused here unchanged: the incoming person
// takes exactly the duty the outgoing person held, nobody is promoted, and no
// third person's duty moves. What differs is WHO may do it (a lead — enforced
// by `firestore.rules`, not by this file), that no request document exists,
// and that the change is written to a CHANGE LOG afterwards — the audit trail
// the ledger asks for, because a hand edit with no record is indistinguishable
// from a regenerate a week later.
//
// The pair below mirrors the swap pair, on purpose: `planShiftReassignment`
// decides without writing anything, and `findReassignedShift` is the evidence
// a success message may be built from after the document is read back
// (A-RC4). The refusal set is the swap planner's, reworded for a lead who is
// looking at the calendar rather than at a request card; the parity test in
// `auraEngine.reassign.test.js` holds the two planners to the same answer on

//
// Closes the limit `mockData.js` was written around: *"with `coLeads > 1` the
// engine puts the extra people in `assignees`, which `downloadCSV`/`downloadICS`
// do not read, so the exports would be silently incomplete."* Both exporters now
// read `assignees`.
//
// FOUR SHIFT SHAPES REACH HERE, and one reader has to serve all of them:
//
//   1. `generateRoster` (V1, the live engine)  — `lead` + `coLead` + `staff`.
//   2. `generateRosterV2`                      — the same three PLUS `assignees`,
//      which is authoritative for the third person onward (a `coLeads: 2`
//      pairing group, or a `slots:` trio).
//   3. the demo transform / a pre-6-May document — `lead` (or a bare `staff`)
//      and nothing else.
//   4. anything hand-edited or swap-mutated, which may DISAGREE with itself.
//
// SHAPE 4 IS WHY `lead`/`coLead` ARE READ FIRST AND `assignees` ONLY AFTER THEM.
// `applyShiftSubstitution` (section 1c) rewrites `lead`, `coLead` and `staff` on
// an accepted swap and does NOT touch `assignees`, so on a V2 shift that has been
// swapped, `assignees` still names the clinician who handed the duty over. Order
// of preference decides what that costs:
//
//   • trusting `assignees` first would put the DEPARTED person in the Assignees
//     column and in the calendar event, flatly contradicting the Lead column
//     beside it;
//   • reading the authoritative pair first, as here, keeps the current holders
//     first and leaves the stale name trailing as an extra assignee — so a trio
//     that has been swapped exports FOUR names.
//
// Four names on a three-person shift is visibly odd; a departed clinician
// exported as its lead is not. Neither is correct, and the exporters cannot make
// stale data fresh: the real repair is for `applyShiftSubstitution` to maintain
// `assignees`, which is a change to the swap contract and is deliberately NOT
// made here. It is logged in the ledger in section 2d.

/**
 * Everybody on a shift, in publication order, deduplicated, never `undefined`.
 *
 * Order: `lead`, then `coLead`, then whatever `assignees` adds. For every shift
 * this repo's two engines actually produce, that is exactly `assignees` — V2
 * writes `assignees[0] === lead` and `assignees[1] === coLead` — so the
 * reordering is invisible except on the self-contradicting shape 4 above.
 *
 * A bare-`staff` legacy shift yields `[]`, the same as it already yields an empty
 * Lead cell: identity is never parsed back out of a formatted display string
 * (`readShiftIdentities` in section 1c documents why that rule exists).
 *
 * Values are String-coerced rather than type-filtered, matching `csvField` and

 * one cell instead of a person silently vanishing from the roster.

// --- 2d. THE EXPORTS' LIMITS LEDGER ------------------------------------------
//
// What a roster master can do today and get a surprising or incomplete file.
// Measured where it says measured, FLAGGED where a judgment call was made rather
// than a fact found — same convention as `rosterEngineV2.js` sections 9 and 10.
// Written after multi-assignee support landed, so items 1-4 are that feature's.
//
//  1. A SWAPPED SHIFT CAN EXPORT ONE NAME TOO MANY. `applyShiftSubstitution`
//     (section 1c) maintains `lead`, `coLead` and `staff` and does NOT maintain
//     `assignees`, so after a colleague covers the lead of a three-person shift
//     the export lists the new lead, the co-lead, the DEPARTED lead and the third
//     assignee — four names for three duties. `shiftAssigneeNames` reads the
//     authoritative pair first so the stale name trails rather than leads, which
//     makes the staleness visible instead of authoritative. → FLAGGED: the repair
//     belongs in the swap contract (maintain `assignees` there), not in the
//     exporters, and it is not made yet.
//  2. THE `Also:` CONVENTION IS NEW AND UNRATIFIED. Three or more people export
//     as `Lead: A, Co: B, Also: C, D` in the ICS SUMMARY. Nothing else in the app
//     writes that string: the calendar cell and the swap modal still render
//     `shift.staff`, which is `buildShiftStaffLabel(lead, coLead)` and still shows
//     two names. So the SAME SHIFT reads as a trio in the .ics and a pair on
//     screen. → FLAGGED for the roster owner: `rosterEngineV2.js` section 10 item
//     1 asks for one display convention across calendar, CSV and ICS; this is
//     three quarters of it.
//  3. `Assignees` SEPARATES ON `'; '`, WHICH IS A CHOICE, NOT A STANDARD. RFC 4180
//     has no list-inside-a-field convention. A consumer splitting on `';'` must
//     trim; one splitting on `', '` will be wrong. Also, the CSV keeps `Lead` and
//     `Co-Lead` AND repeats both inside `Assignees` — deliberate redundancy so the
//     old columns stay byte-compatible, but it does mean the same name appears
//     twice in a row.
//  4. A SHIFT WHOSE ONLY RECORD IS A BARE `staff` NAME EXPORTS NO ASSIGNEES. A
//     pre-6-May document has `staff: 'Brandon'` and no `lead`, and identity is
//     never parsed back out of a display string (the rule `readShiftIdentities`
//     exists to enforce). Its Lead, Co-Lead and Assignees cells are all empty
//     while the ICS SUMMARY still shows the name, because SUMMARY falls back to
//     `staff` verbatim. Pre-existing for Lead/Co-Lead; item 4 only records that
//     the new column inherits it rather than fixing it.
//  5. NO VTIMEZONE, AND EVERY EVENT IS ALL-DAY. `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE` carries no
//     time and no timezone, so a shift is a whole day in the importer's calendar
//     whatever hours it actually runs — and the hours model in
//     `rosterEngineV2.js` now knows those durations. The ICS does not read them.
//  6. FOLDING COUNTS CODE POINTS, NOT OCTETS (§3.1 wants octets). Documented at
//     `foldICSLine`: non-ASCII names fold late, which errs long rather than
//     splitting a surrogate pair. A team of four with long non-ASCII names on one
//     shift can therefore emit a SUMMARY line over 75 bytes.
//  7. THE FORMULA GUARD CHANGES THE DATA IT PROTECTS. A task or a person legitimately
//     named starting `-` or `@` is exported with a leading apostrophe (M10's fix),
//     so the CSV is not a faithful round-trip of the roster document.
//  8. NEITHER EXPORT CARRIES `unfilled`. A roster with slots nobody could staff
//     exports as though those slots did not exist — the CSV has no row and the
//     ICS no event for a gap, and nothing in either file says a gap was reported.
//     That is the single biggest hole in both formats and it predates every
//     feature above: the engine's core value is that it refuses out loud, and the
//     file a roster master actually opens is silent about the refusal.
//     → FLAGGED: needs a decision about whether gaps belong in the same file.
