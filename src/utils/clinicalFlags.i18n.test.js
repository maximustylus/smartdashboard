/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * CHIP PARITY — every language must parse to the same answer as English
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * `CD10` / `P7.7`. The falls and Healthier SG questions shipped in English only,
 * and `chatSteps.js` skipped them for ms/zh/ta — so a Malay, Chinese or Tamil
 * speaker got a shorter assessment and those two flags stayed unknown. Translating
 * the chips makes both questions appear for everybody.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THAT IS THE DANGEROUS HALF, NOT THE SAFE ONE. `parseFallsAnswer` and
 *    `parseHealthierSg` match TOKEN LISTS, and those lists were English-only:
 *
 *      matchesNoFalls    = ['no falls', 'none', 'no']
 *      matchesEnrolledNo = ['no', 'not enrolled']
 *
 *    "Tiada jatuh" matches nothing in the first, so `parseFallsAnswer` falls
 *    through to `falls = 1, fallsRisk = true`. Translate the chips alone and every
 *    Malay, Chinese and Tamil speaker who had NEVER fallen is recorded as having
 *    fallen — scored for it, shown it on their result, and handed a printed slip
 *    stating it to a community centre. The step-skip rule exists to refuse exactly
 *    this trade: missing data is recoverable, wrong data is not, and wrong data
 *    produced from a question the person could read looks complete.
 *
 * So this file asserts the property that makes translating safe: **chip `n` in any
 * language parses to exactly what chip `n` in English parses to.** It is written
 * against the chips themselves rather than against remembered expectations, so
 * adding a language or rewording a chip fails here rather than in public.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ALREADY EARNED ITS KEEP. The natural Tamil for "two or more" is
 *    "இரண்டு அல்லது அதற்கு மேற்பட்ட". அல்லது ("or") begins with அல்ல, a Tamil
 *    negator; Tamil negation is postfix, so `isNegated` read it as denying the
 *    "இரண்டு" immediately before it and the chip parsed as ONE fall. Nothing about
 *    the sentence looks wrong — it is correct Tamil. Only this test saw it.
