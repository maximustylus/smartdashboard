/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * TEAM PATHS — the ONE place a Firestore path is composed
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * NEXUS was built for one ten-person team, with every collection at the root of
 * the database and the team itself hardcoded in three separate files. Serving 28
 * allied health professions across several SingHealth institutions means a team
 * becomes a THING with an id, and every document it owns lives beneath it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: NOTHING ELSE IN THE APP MAY COMPOSE
 * A FIRESTORE PATH BY HAND. Not `doc(db, 'system_data', 'roster_2026')`, not a
 * template string, not "just this once". A path composed somewhere else is a path
 * that keeps pointing at the OLD global collection after the migration — which
 * means one department's roster silently written into another department's
 * document. That is the worst outcome this project has available to it, it would
 * not throw, and nothing on screen would say so.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING. It is pure string work: every function returns
 * an ARRAY OF PATH SEGMENTS for the caller to spread into `doc(db, ...)` or
 * `collection(db, ...)`. That keeps it unit-testable without a Firestore mock,
 * and means a path bug surfaces as a failing assertion here rather than as a
 * permission-denied in a clinician's browser.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS TEAM-SCOPED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * TEAM-SCOPED — everything a department owns and no other department may see:
 *
 *   teams/{teamId}                       the team record
 *   teams/{teamId}/members/{uid}         who is in it, and their grade/FTE/skills
 *   teams/{teamId}/rosters/{year}        was `system_data/roster_2026`
 *   teams/{teamId}/swaps/{swapId}        was `shift_swaps`
 *   teams/{teamId}/wellbeing/{uid}       was `wellbeing_history/{directoryId}`
 *   teams/{teamId}/pulse/{period}        was `system_data/daily_pulse`
 *   teams/{teamId}/loads/{uid}           was `staff_loads/{directoryId}`
 *   teams/{teamId}/workload/{period}     was `monthly_workload`
 *   teams/{teamId}/reports/{year}        was `system_data/reports_{year}`
 *   teams/{teamId}/attendance/{period}   was `system_data/monthly_attendance`
 *   teams/{teamId}/projects/{year}/staff/{uid}
 *                                        was `cep_team` for the current year and
 *                                        `archive_{year}` for every other one —
 *                                        two collections holding one shape
 *   teams/{teamId}/feed/{postId}         was `feed_posts`
 *   teams/{teamId}/notifications/{id}    was `notifications`
 *
 * NOT TEAM-SCOPED, each for a stated reason — this list is as load-bearing as the
 * one above, because scoping one of these would BREAK it:
 *
 *   users/{uid}              A PERSON, not a membership. One human has one profile
 *                            and may belong to more than one team; `teamIds` on the
 *                            profile is what links them. Scoping it per team would
 *                            mean a clinician editing their name in two places.
 *   lead_requests/{uid}      A declaration made BEFORE any team exists. It cannot
 *                            live under a team by definition — that is the point of
 *                            the approval step.
 *   config/{docId}           Cluster-wide settings: the login domain allowlist and
 *                            the super-admin list. Team-scoping the thing that
 *                            decides who may create a team is circular.
 *   beta_feedback/{id}       A deliberately PUBLIC write-only sink — the sandbox
 *                            widget has no login and therefore no team. Reconciled
 *                            2026-08-18; see `firestore.rules`.
 *   community_assessments/   Public screening telemetry, written by members of the
 *                            public with no account at all. Same reasoning.
 *   resources/{id}           Read only by a Cloud Function via the Admin SDK, which
 *                            bypasses rules entirely. No client touches it.
 *   smart_database/{id}      AURA's audit sink. Left global on purpose: it is
 *                            append-only, never read back, and its documents carry
 *                            their own author. Flagged rather than moved, so the
 *                            decision is visible.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IDENTITY: `uid`, NEVER A DISPLAY NAME
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The old model keyed documents by human name — `shift_swaps.targetStaff` was
 * `"Ying Xian"`, `wellbeing_history/fadzlynn` was a directory id. `firestore.rules`
 * has carried the diagnosis for months: *"The only durable fix is to stop keying
 * documents by display name."* At ten people you get away with it. Across 28
 * professions and several institutions, two people called Sarah is a certainty,
 * and the failure is silent mis-routing of one clinician's wellbeing record into
 * another's.
 *
 * So every per-person path below takes a `uid`. A display name is a field to
 * RENDER, never a key to route by. `assertUid` refuses anything that looks like a
 * name, which is a cheap guard against the old habit surviving a copy-paste.
