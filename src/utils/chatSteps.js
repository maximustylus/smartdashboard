/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * CHAT STEPS — which questions this person actually gets asked
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * The assessment used to be a fixed run of thirteen questions: `currentStep + 1`
 * until the end. Two requirements broke that, and they break it the same way.
 *
 * ── 1. SOME QUESTIONS ONLY APPLY TO SOME PEOPLE ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Regional Health System reviewer noted that for the 60+ cohort the portal
 * screens the wrong thing: for somebody being considered for an Active Ageing
 * Centre, falls history and functional mobility matter more than a weekly minutes
 * figure. But asking a 24-year-old whether they have fallen in the past year is
 * noise, and every unnecessary question costs completions in the population least
 * likely to finish.
 *
 * ── 2. A QUESTION SOMEBODY CANNOT READ IS WORSE THAN ONE NOT ASKED ──────────
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE RULE THAT MATTERS. The portal serves English, Bahasa Melayu,
 *    中文 and தமிழ். A new question added in English only would appear
 *    mid-conversation, in the wrong language, to somebody who then answers it
 *    anyway — and the answer feeds `calculateRiskScore` and `selectCTA`. That is
 *    not a missing data point; it is a WRONG one, produced by the tool asking
 *    something the person could not read.
 *
 *    So a step with no prompt in the active language is SKIPPED. The person gets a
 *    shorter, correct assessment rather than a longer, corrupted one, and the flag
 *    is simply unknown — which the scoring already treats as a deficit rather than
 *    as health (`CP2`).
 *
 *    Adding a translation is then a one-line change: put the prompt at that index
 *    in that language's dictionary and the question appears. Nothing here needs
 *    editing. Tracked as `CD10` with the other translation debt.
 */

    // conditional question cannot slip through in the wrong language.
    //
    // Addressed by NAME where the caller passes a keyed object, falling back to the
    // index for callers still passing the positional array. The fallback is
    // transitional: it exists so the array-to-keyed migration could land without
    // rewriting every caller in one commit, and should go once none remain.

            // Skipping is the safe direction: the question is optional by
            // construction, and the flag defaults to unknown.

/**
 * The next step to ask after `from`, or `-1` when there are none left.
 *
 * Absolute indices are preserved deliberately: `prompts`, `quickReplies`,
 * `reflections` and `DOMAIN_CONFIG` are four parallel arrays across four
 * languages, and renumbering them to close a gap is precisely how a question goes
 * missing in one language and nobody notices.
