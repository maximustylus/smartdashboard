/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * THE NATIONAL ALLIED HEALTH LIST — 28 PROFESSIONS
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * The authoritative Singapore Ministry of Health / National Allied Health
 * Services taxonomy, transcribed from the published list supplied by the roster
 * owner. This module is the VOCABULARY for the arrangement picker: who the
 * professions are, what each is officially called, and how they nest.
 *
 * WHY THIS REPLACED AN INVENTED LIST. The picker previously offered names I had
 * chosen — "Medical Laboratory", "Cardiology", "Physiotherapy". Those are
 * paraphrases of departments. The list names PRACTITIONERS ("Medical Laboratory
 * Technologist / Scientist", "Physiotherapist"), which is what a colleague
 * opening this app will recognise as their own designation. Using the official
 * list also settled a question I had flagged as a guess: **Pulmonary and
 * Respiratory are not the same service.** "Respiratory Therapist" is profession
 * 26 in its own right, while "Pulmonary" is one of five sub-disciplines of
 * profession 12, Medical Technologist / Physiologist — alongside Cardiac, Neuro,
 * Sleep and Vascular. The taxonomy answered it; I had been inferring.
 *
 * TWO PROFESSIONS NEST. 12 carries five sub-disciplines and 24 carries six, so
 * the 28 professions are 37 selectable leaves. The parent of a nesting
 * profession is a GROUP LABEL, not a choice: a roster belongs to a cardiac lab
 * or a sleep lab, not to "medical technology" in general, so selecting the
 * parent would mean selecting nothing in particular.
 *
 * `id` values are stable slugs and are what the UI and every test key on. Never
 * renumber or re-slug an existing one: the ids outlive the display names.
 *
 * ── A NOTE ON TRUST, WHICH BELONGS HERE RATHER THAN IN A COMMIT MESSAGE ──
 *
 * Listing all 28 does NOT mean 28 known rostering patterns. At the time of
 * writing the owner has interviewed FOUR teams (medical laboratory scientists,
 * embryologists, psychologists, physiotherapists) and works in a fifth
 * (clinical exercise physiology, whose real duty names are in
 * `auraEngine.js`'s `LIVE_ROSTER_DEFAULTS`). Every other arrangement is
 * INFERRED — a plausible service, not a described one — and carries a
 * `correction` checklist saying so on screen. `provenance` is the field that
 * distinguishes them, and the picker shows it, so nobody has to remember which
 * is which in front of a room.
