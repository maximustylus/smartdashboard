/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * SCREENING CHIPS — the answer text that is ALSO parser input
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * Every other quick-reply row in `AuraChat.jsx` lives inline in its language's
 * dictionary, and should. These two do not, and the reason is not tidiness.
 *
 * The falls and Healthier SG chips are read back by `parseFallsAnswer` and
 * `parseHealthierSg` in `src/utils/clinicalFlags.js`, which match TOKENS. Chip text
 * and token list are therefore one artefact in two files, and until these rows were
 * translated that coupling was invisible — the matchers were English-only, and
 * `chatSteps.js` skipped the questions for ms/zh/ta, so nothing ever exercised it.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE CHIPS HAD BEEN TRANSLATED ALONE, which is the
 *    obvious way to do this and the reason this module exists:
 *
 *    `matchesNoFalls` was `['no falls', 'none', 'no']`. "Tiada jatuh" matches none
 *    of them, so `parseFallsAnswer` would have fallen through to `falls = 1,
 *    fallsRisk = true`. EVERY Malay, Chinese and Tamil speaker who had never fallen
 *    would have been recorded as having fallen — added to their risk score, shown
 *    on their result, and printed on a handover slip to a community centre as fact.
 *
 *    A question in a language somebody cannot read produces a wrong answer rather
 *    than a missing one; that is why `chatSteps.js` skips it. A chip whose parser
 *    does not speak the same language produces a wrong answer from a question they
 *    CAN read, which is worse, because nothing about it looks incomplete.
 *
 * So the text lives here, beside nothing else, and `clinicalFlags.i18n.test.js`
 * imports both this and the parsers and asserts chip-for-chip parity: chip `n` in
 * every language must parse to exactly what chip `n` in English parses to. Adding a
 * language, or rewording a chip, fails that test rather than the public.
 *
 * ── PROVENANCE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ms/zh/ta STRINGS ARE MACHINE TRANSLATIONS AND HAVE NOT BEEN REVIEWED BY A
 *    NATIVE SPEAKER. These ones are mine (Claude); the handover slip's flag lines
 *    in `slipFlagLines.js` are Gemini 3.1 Pro's. Two models is not a second
 *    opinion — neither of us can read back what we wrote — so the review debt is
 *    ONE item covering both sets, tracked in `COMMUNITY_TODO.md`.
 *
 *    `TRANSLATION-BRIEF.md` carries a back-translation of each string so a reviewer
 *    can check them in minutes. Shipping them was the owner's decision, and the
 *    alternative on the table was continuing to ask nobody — which is what the
 *    portal did for its whole life. These are QUESTIONS rather than clinical
 *    instructions, and a question read slightly oddly is recoverable in a way that
 *    a mistranslated "call 995" is not.
