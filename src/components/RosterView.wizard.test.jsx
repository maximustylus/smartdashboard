/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * ROSTER VIEW — THE CONFIGURE WIZARD, IN BOTH UNIVERSES
 * ==============================================================================
 * Runner: Vitest + @testing-library/react (jsdom)
 * Run:    npx vitest run src/components/RosterView.wizard.test.jsx
 *
 * The grade-aware tables are a SANDBOX-ONLY change. This file is the gate on that
 * word "only".
 *
 * The live wizard writes into `config.staff` / `config.tasks`, which is exactly
 * what `prepareRosterWrite` hands to `setDoc` against `system_data/roster_2026` —
 * the document four real clinicians read their week out of. So the two
 * comma-separated textareas are asserted here down to their `id`, their class
 * list and their value, and every one of the new sandbox controls is asserted
 * ABSENT. A future refactor that "tidies up" the wizard by giving live mode the
 * tables has to turn this file red first.
 *
 * The demo half of the file is the mirror image: the textareas must be gone
 * there, because two ways to enter a staff pool in one wizard is two answers to
 * "who is being rostered".
 *
 * SECTION 3 is the band-boundary RULER — the control that replaced the six number
 * boxes. Its whole claim is that a gap, an overlap or a partition that misses an
 * end of the AH scale is not EXPRESSIBLE, so the tests drive every divider to
 * its extremes by keyboard and by pointer and assert, off the rendered DOM,
 * that the four bands are still contiguous and still cover AH7–AH17. Nobody has
 * seen this control rendered: jsdom paints nothing, so what is asserted here is
 * STRUCTURE, ARIA and arithmetic. Spacing, drag feel and colour contrast are
 * explicitly NOT covered and need a human with a browser.

 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS BLOCK USED TO BE CALLED "the Configure wizard is exactly what it was",
 *    AND IT WAS RIGHT UNTIL `R3`/`R4`. It pinned two comma-separated textareas —
 *    `roster-staff-pool` and `roster-tasks` — their exact class strings, and a
 *    Generate button gated by `validateRosterConfig`.
 *
 *    That was the honest UI for the engine behind it. Live mode ran
 *    `generateRoster`: a round-robin that rotated a list of NAMES and assigned
 *    `staff[taskIdx % staff.length]` as lead, Monday to Friday. It could not see a
 *    grade, an FTE, a skill, a leave date or a rule, so there was nothing else to
 *    configure. Everything the sandbox demonstrated for months — grade bands, skill
 *    matching, part-time fairness, hours ceilings, the grade floor shipped in
 *    v1.18.0 — was reachable only there.
 *
 *    Both modes now run `generateRosterV2`, so both get the screen that configures
 *    it. These tests assert the new arrangement, and the old ones are deleted
 *    rather than skipped: a test asserting the textareas still exist would now be
 *    asserting a regression.
 *
 * The one difference that remains is real, and is pinned below: in the sandbox the
 * staff are TYPED, because there is no team; in a department they ARE the team, and
 * the table shows them read-only.

// ─── 3. THE BAND BOUNDARY RULER ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The number boxes are gone. What replaced them is one ruler of AH7–AH17 with a
// divider between each adjacent pair of bands — THREE of them since the four-band
// split — and the reason is not cosmetic: independent numbers can be left
// describing a GAP (a grade in no band, and therefore a clinician silently barred
// from every band-gated task), an OVERLAP, or a partition that stops short of an
// end of the scale. Dividers cannot describe any of those, because the bands are
// derived from where the dividers sit.
//
// "Cannot" is a strong claim, so it is not asserted — it is attacked. The tests
// below drive each divider as far as the keyboard and the pointer will take it,
// past its neighbours and past both ends of the scale, and after every attempt
// read the four bands back OFF THE DOM and check they are contiguous and cover
// AH7–AH17.
//
// 🛡️ AND THEY ASK FOR A DIVIDER BY ITS `aria-label`, never by its index. Adding one
// band renumbered every handle: `getAllByRole('slider')[0]` was the junior|senior
// boundary and became the non-exempt|junior one, so thirteen tests in this file
// carried on driving and measuring a DIFFERENT CONTROL from the one they name. They
// failed loudly this time only because the numbers happened to differ; an index
// that lands on a divider whose value matches is a test that has quietly stopped
// testing anything. Hence the three named accessors below.
