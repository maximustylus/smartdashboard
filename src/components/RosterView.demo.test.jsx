/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * ROSTER VIEW — SANDBOX / DEMO MODE (component tests)
 * ==============================================================================
 * Runner: Vitest + @testing-library/react (jsdom)
 * Run:    npx vitest run src/components/RosterView.demo.test.jsx
 *
 * This file is the deploy gate for the demo rostering path. Nobody can log into
 * the app to click through it before it ships, so these assertions are the
 * verification:
 *
 *   1. Configure → Generate really generates: the calendar renders shifts that
 *      came out of `generateRosterV2`, matched against the engine's own output
 *      for the same configuration rather than against hardcoded strings.
 *   2. NO FIRESTORE FUNCTION IS CALLED. `setDoc` and `addDoc` are the two writes
 *      RosterView can perform, `onSnapshot` is the only read, and demo mode must
 *      reach none of them. This is the safety property the whole feature rests
 *      on, so it is asserted directly on the mocked module.
 *   3. An unfillable configuration surfaces the slots it could not staff, with
 *      the constraint that bound, instead of a silently empty calendar.
 *   4. THE GRADE GATES BIND IN THE RENDERED OUTPUT. A task restricted to
 *      Senior/Principal is never shown with a junior as its lead, and the
 *      converse gate holds too — checked by reading the lead's name out of the
 *      calendar and looking its grade up in the fixture, not by trusting the
 *      engine's own report.
 *   5. A configuration the engine would refuse cannot be SUBMITTED: Generate is
 *      disabled and the engine's own reason is on screen beside it.
 *   6. THE HOURS MODEL IS REACHABLE, and reaching it changes the roster: a task's
 *      length typed into its drawer, a department week typed beside the ruler, and
 *      the resulting per-person hours, weekly cap and hours-bound unfilled slots
 *      all on screen. Sections 6 and 7 below are the answer to the audit's D1 —
 *      "1,722 engine lines and 178 tests that no user can reach" — so they drive
 *      the real controls rather than calling the mapper.
 *   7. A MULTI-SLOT SHIFT SHOWS ALL OF ITS PEOPLE. A three-slot task renders three
 *      distinct assignees in the calendar cell, not the two that fit
 *      `buildShiftStaffLabel`, and a slot nobody can fill is named as that slot.
 *
 * `firebase.js` is mocked because importing it for real calls `initializeApp`
 * and `getMessaging` at module scope, which cannot work in jsdom — and because a
 * test of "no live data is touched" must not be able to touch live data.

//   1. AGAINST THE ENGINE, by running `generateRosterV2` on the fixture here and
//      re-auditing the finished roster with `auditHardConstraints` — a second,
//      independent read-back, not the engine's own self-report.
//   2. IN THE RENDERED OUTPUT, by reading names out of the calendar's own day cells.
//      That is the half that catches a field which the fixture states and the wizard
//      drops: a `recurrence`, a `continuity`, a cohort `window` or a `quota` that did
//      not survive the tables would produce a DIFFERENT roster on screen from the one
//      the engine gives the fixture, and the last test in this section compares the
//      two shift by shift for all four.
//
// WHY THE MONTH NAVIGATION EXISTS HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE IN THIS FILE: three of the
// four claims are only visible ACROSS months. A clinic on the third Wednesday occurs
// once per month, so "the same principal every time" cannot be seen in one month's
// square; a four-month cohort block cannot be seen in one month at all.

// gone is five inventions, not five capabilities. The skill gate is still exercised HERE,
// through the worked example's CPET duty, in sections 1 and 8.

// sections above render their shape into the calendar because their capability is
// invisible in the fixture (a monthly recurrence, a cohort window and a quota floor all
// look like ordinary fields until the engine runs). These two are checked against the
// engine and then handed to the ONE render test below, which compares the calendar
// against `generateRosterV2` shift by shift for all seven — so a field that failed to
// survive the wizard still fails a test, without seven more jsdom mounts.

// "removing it changes the roster". A constraint that agrees with what fairness would
// have done anyway is a decoy test, and this file has been caught shipping one before
// (see the medical laboratory fixture's own header).
