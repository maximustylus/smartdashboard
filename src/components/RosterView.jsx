// `DEMO_SHAPES` is FIVE STRUCTURES plus two openly fictional demos. It was twelve

// offered under a real profession's name. A shape says "this is how the physiotherapists
// do it — adapt it", which is true; a per-department fixture said "this is how art
// therapists do it", which was not. `mockData.js` owns the list and its order; this file
// does not sort, filter or re-order it, and nothing here may assume a position in it.
//
// `PROFESSION_OPTIONS` is the national list's 28 professions (37 selectable leaves,
// two of them nesting), sorted in `mockData.js` and rendered here with `<optgroup>`
// wherever the list nests. It is VOCABULARY: choosing a profession picks the LABEL on the
// configuration and nothing else — no duties, no grades, no rules. That is what lets an
// art therapist ride the physiotherapy shape and see their own designation on the
// result.
//
// `suggestedShapeFor` is the roster owner's own non-binding pairing of profession to
// likely starting point. It is rendered as a SUGGESTION and is never applied
// automatically: a suggestion that loads itself is a claim about that profession's
// service.
//
// `provenance` is deliberately NOT imported here. The attribution panel keys off
// `attribution` and `sourceProfession` being present, which is ONE source for "what does
// this say about where it came from"; reading `provenance` here as well would be two,
// and the two would eventually disagree in front of a roster master. That they agree is

 * recorded: the message could be destroyed by picking a persona, it was invisible
 * on the persona grid, and answering a roster question meant leaving the roster.
 * The request now renders where the shift is, and one tap answers it.
 *
 * WHAT EACH BUTTON DOES, STATED ON SCREEN. "Cover this shift" runs the verified
 * sequence in `respondToCoverageRequest` — write the roster, read the document
 * back, FIND the substitution in it, and only then mark the request approved. The
 * card says so, because a person is being asked to take on clinical work and
 * "what happens when I press this" is not a detail.
 *
 * PURE RENDERING. Every sentence comes from `rosterCoverage`; every outcome
 * message comes from the observed read-back or from the engine's refusal reason.
 * This component decides nothing and asserts nothing.

     * spelled-out nine — because that is what the round-robin

     * document did not exist until today.

     * the modal. Found by `RosterView.alerts.test.jsx` failing to open the
     * confirmation modal, which is the same thing happening in miniature.

     * the department is demonstrably already running. They arrive as ordinary
     * editable rows with the engine's defaults for everything the old model could
     * not express, and the first Generate stores them properly.

    // one shift and the possibility of answering the same request twice.

    // query — no `collection`, no `query`, no `onSnapshot`. The sandbox's promise
    // is that it neither reads nor writes live data, and a subscription to real
    // colleagues' coverage requests would break the reading half of it.
    //
    // Reads whole snapshots rather than `docChanges()`: `added` events fire once,
    // which is exactly how M5 lost a request to a re-render. A full snapshot is
    // idempotent — the card shows what is PENDING right now.

     * THE MUTATOR CANNOT FOLLOW YET, and pretending otherwise would be worse than
     * saying so: the roster document stores day arrays of DISPLAY NAMES
     * (`shift.lead === user.name`), and `planSwapApplication` matches against them.
     * Converting those to uids means changing the engine, the wizard, the demo
     * fixtures and most of 1,798 tests — a change with its own risk budget, not a

     * WAS `loadExampleDepartment`, which took no argument and closed over the single
     * example fixture; then `loadArrangement`, which took one of twelve per-department
     * fixtures. It now takes a SHAPE, and the body below is unchanged from that
     * parameterisation — deliberately, because the full worked example passes exactly the
     * object this function has always read and its existing tests therefore still
     * describe the same behaviour.
     *
     * THE CHOSEN PROFESSION IS NOT AN ARGUMENT TO THIS FUNCTION, and that is the claim
     * the whole change rests on. A shape's rows, rules, start date and run length come
     * from the shape; the profession is a label held in its own piece of state. So the
     * same shape loaded by an art therapist and by a physiotherapist produces the same
     * rows and therefore the same roster, which is asserted rather than asserted-by-
     * comment in `RosterView.demo.test.jsx`.
     *
     * EVERYTHING the fixture holds lands somewhere the visitor can see and change:
     * names, grades, FTE, leave dates, per-person daily caps and cohort windows into
     * the staff rows; days or a monthly recurrence, lead bands, the co-lead toggle,
     * continuity, a quota, a session length, a slot list and a category into the task
     * rows; the three band boundaries, the two hours boxes and the three department
     * limits into the panels that own them. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE PICKER HONEST: an
     * arrangement whose interesting field had no control would load, generate, and be
     * uneditable — a demo of a capability nobody in the room could then adjust.
     *
     * Two things travel on the rows without a column of their own — staff `skills` and
     * a task's `requiresSkill` — because the full worked example's single unfillable slot
     * exists precisely because only two people hold CPET. They are rendered read-only in
     * the tables rather than hidden.

         * ======================================================================
         *
         * It used to come from `prepareRosterWrite(config)`, which defaults to
         * `generateRoster`: a round-robin that rotates a list of NAMES and assigns
         * `staff[taskIdx % staff.length]` as lead and the next one as co-lead,
         * Monday to Friday. It could not see a grade, an FTE, a skill, a leave
         * date or a rule, because its input was two comma-separated strings.
         *
         * Every capability the sandbox has demonstrated for months — grade bands,
         * skill matching, part-time fairness, working-hours ceilings, consecutive-day
         * limits, the grade floor shipped in v1.18.0 — existed only there. This is
         * the line that ends that split.
         *
         * ⚠️ IT WILL PRODUCE A DIFFERENT ROSTER FROM THE ONE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
         *    WORKING TO, AND THAT IS THE POINT RATHER THAN A REGRESSION. v2
         *    respects constraints v1 ignored, so the allocation legitimately
         *    changes. The confirmation modal is what makes that a decision.
         *
         * ⚠️ `prepareRosterWrite` IS STILL THE GATE. It is what refuses to write an
         *    empty schedule — a defect this repository has already had, where an
         *    empty write blanked the whole document and reported success — so the
         *    engine is passed to it rather than called around it.

    //     quotes the shift as it actually reads. There is no success literal on any

    //   an UNMET QUOTA FLOOR is not a bug and not a broken roster — a floor cannot be
    //   met by inventing capacity, so the engine prefers whoever is behind for every
    //   occurrence it can and then says who was still short. Mixed into the general
    //   warnings list it reads as "something went wrong"; given its own block with one
    //   sentence of framing it reads as "this is what your policy cost".
    //
    //   a WINDOW-BLOCKED SLOT is the one `unfilled` reason whose cause is invisible in
    //   the tables: the people are in the pool, none of them is on leave, and they are
    //   still not eligible. Saying how many of the gaps are that, in words, is the
    //   difference between a report and a puzzle.
    //
    // Classified in `rosterWizard.js` rather than here, and pinned by end-to-end tests
    // that ask the classifier about a sentence the ENGINE actually produced — so this
    // component holds no opinion about the engine's prose and there is one definition
    // of "is this a quota floor" for the panel and the tests to share.

                    shorter, and it retires the whole boxes problem: no fill to blend
                    into the card, no ring to keep visible, nothing to keep aligned.

            {/* CALENDAR GRID
                📱 SEVEN COLUMNS BECOME ONE BELOW `sm:`, AND THE REASONING MATTERS.
                At 375px a seven-column month grid gives each day about 48px of width.
                The cells already render at 9px with a 90px inner scroller, and 48px is
                not enough for "EFT" and "Lead: Fadzlynn, Co: Derlinder" at any size a
                person can read — shrinking further is not a fix, it is the same
                unreadable grid with smaller type. So below `sm:` the month lays out as
                a LIST: one full-width row per day, in date order, each naming its own
                weekday because the column headings it used to get that from are no
                longer on screen.

                NOTHING IS HIDDEN AND NOTHING IS ADDED. The same shifts, the same
                "not staffed" markers, the same days — including the empty ones, which
                are the days somebody is checking when they ask "am I off on the 12th".
                The leading blanks before the 1st are the one exception: they exist only
                to align a date under a weekday column, and with one column there is no
                column to align to.

                IS A ONE-PERSON LIST THE BETTER MOBILE DEFAULT? Honestly, yes — "My
                week" is the view a clinician on a phone actually wants, and the grid is
                a desktop affordance for whoever is building the roster. But changing
                which view opens by default is a BEHAVIOUR change, not a layout one, and
                an existing user who never pressed either button would find a different
                screen than the one they left. So the grid stays the default and stays
                readable; the recommendation is in the report, not in this commit. */}

                                    MISSING FROM.
                                    The engine's honesty used to live only in a list
                                    under the grid, which meant the calendar — the
                                    thing people actually read — showed a fully failed
                                    day as an empty square, indistinguishable from a
                                    day nothing was configured for. These come from
                                    `unfilled`, not from `roster`, precisely because a
                                    fully failed day has no roster key at all.

                                    NOT A BUTTON, and that is deliberate twice over:
                                    there is nothing to swap on a duty nobody holds,
                                    and a button here would make this absence look
                                    like an assignment. Dashed, muted, and it says
                                    "not staffed" in words rather than relying on the
                                    border. Focusable so a keyboard user reaches the
                                    reason, which is carried on `title` (hover) and in
                                    `aria-label` (screen readers) — the engine's own
                                    sentence, verbatim, naming the constraint that
                                    bound. The printable list below keeps every

            {/* --- 🧪 SANDBOX REPORT: WHAT THE ENGINE KNEW ----------------------
                Requirement 4. `generateRosterV2` returns far more than a roster —
                the Monday it actually started from, the per-person load, the
                warnings it raised before filling a single slot, and every slot it
                could NOT fill with the constraint that bound. A calendar alone
                throws all of that away, and the last one matters most: a day on
                which every slot failed produces no roster key at all, so an empty
                square is indistinguishable from a day nothing was configured for.
                This panel is the difference.

                DELIBERATELY ABSENT: `score.softPenalty`. It is unnormalised and
                not comparable across differently-shaped configurations — a
                20-staff/4-task run scores 160 while a genuinely overloaded
                6-staff/10-task run scores 19.83 — so shown as a headline it would
                say the opposite of the truth. `score.hardViolations` IS shown:
                that one is measured by re-auditing the finished roster, and 0 is a
                claim the engine checked rather than asserted. */}

                        a modal and it closes the moment the roster is drafted. What the room
                        then looks at is a finished roster, and if the only place that said

                        panel that just disappeared, a borrowed shape would quietly become

                        WAS AN AMBER WARNING PANEL, rendered from a `correction` block, and
                        it went with the six invented arrangements it existed to apologise
                        for. Nothing in the picker now claims to be a service it is not, so
                        there is nothing to disclaim — this states two facts instead: the
                        profession the visitor chose (or nothing, if they did not) and the
                        team whose structure the shape came from. Rendered from the loaded
                        shape's own `attribution`, so it appears for whichever shape declares
                        one and for no other, and never for a team who typed their own roster
                        in, where naming somebody else's profession would be a false
                        statement about their own data.

                        It sits ABOVE the run summary on purpose. Reading order is the

                            ITS HISTORY, BECAUSE THE LAST STEP WAS A CORRECTION AND NOT AN
                            IMPROVEMENT. It was one button ("Load example department"), then
                            five cards, then one dropdown of TWELVE ARRANGEMENTS — one per
                            department — and 23 more were about to be written so that every
                            profession on the national list had one. Seven of the twelve were invented
                            services offered under a real profession's name with an amber
                            "please correct this" panel attached. The panel was the tell.
                            The roster owner stopped it: "other professions can also ride on
                            the configurations of the 5. That's the purpose of this roster's
                            new version — so roster masters can configure for their team
                            regardless of their profession."
                            SO THE TWO CONTROLS ARE A PROFESSION AND A SHAPE, and they are
                            different kinds of thing. The profession is the visitor's own
                            designation, from the national published list, and it LABELS the result
                            — it selects no duty, grade or rule, which is what lets an art
                            therapist ride the physiotherapists' structure and still see
                            "Art Therapist" on their roster. The shape is a STRUCTURE, and
                            every one of the five is attributed on screen to the profession
                            that described it, because "this is how the physiotherapists do
                            it — adapt it" is true and "this is how art therapists do it"

                            markup: a shape carries `attribution`, and every shape that
                            carries one shows it. A shape added later therefore cannot be
                            presented as anonymous structure just because whoever added it
                            forgot the caption — the field is the thing that has to be
                            filled in.

                            collapsed five cards into one dropdown for. Native <select>s:
                            iOS and Android render them as full-height wheels, so 37
                            professions cost one tap and no vertical space, and both are
                            keyboard- and screen-reader-operable without any work from us.
                            Only the CHOSEN shape's description renders, so the panel's
                            height does not grow with the list.
                            A typed-in team still works and is still the point of the tables
                            below: "Start blank" is the first option in the shape list, a
                            name alone is enough, and every column beside it is optional. */}

                                            sub-discipline produces, and a sentence that
                                            reads as a mistake gets read as a mistake about
                                            the reader. "Your profession" is the same fact
                                            and survives all 37 leaves.

                                            ⚠️ AND IT SAYS ONE TEAM, NOT A PROFESSION.
                                            It used to read "the shape your own profession
                                            described to us" — which told a respiratory
                                            therapist at any other SingHealth institution
                                            that their PROFESSION had described a structure
                                            ONE team at one hospital described. Every shape
                                            here is one team at one site (`sourceScope` says
                                            so), and there are 27 other allied health
                                            professions carrying the same exposure. A
                                            profession is not a team, and the copy must
