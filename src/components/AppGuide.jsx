          ⚠️ THIS PANEL DESCRIBED A PRODUCT THAT DOES NOT EXIST (`Q7`). It read:
             "AURA's Zero-Conflict rostering architecture. It predicts case volumes
             and automatically routes the right skill-mix to the right wards."

             Nothing forecasts anything: `grep -rniE "forecast|predict"` over both
             engines returns nothing, and there is no ward model at all. The live
             path is `prepareRosterWrite` -> `generateRoster`, a cyclic rotation
             assigning the lead of task *i* by `staffOrder[i % staff.length]` — it
             reads no skills, no grades and no leave.

             The constraint-aware engine that DOES respect those things,
             `generateRosterV2`, is wired to the DEMO PATH ONLY (see the import
             comment in `RosterView.jsx`), so the sentence was untrue for every
             real user reading this guide. `README.md` carried the same claim and
             was corrected in the 2026-09-10 rewrite; this was the last live copy
             of it.

             Anything added here must be true of the LIVE path, or say plainly
             which mode it belongs to.
