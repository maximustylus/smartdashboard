/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * ROSTER WIZARD — THE SANDBOX'S GRADE-AWARE TABLES (presentation only)
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * The three controls that replaced the sandbox wizard's two comma-separated
 * textareas:
 *
 *   1. `BandBoundaryEditor` — ONE RULER of the AH7–AH17 scale with two draggable
 *      dividers, cutting it into the junior / senior / principal regions. It sits
 *      ABOVE both tables because everything below it resolves against it: move a
 *      divider and the grade range beside every task's chips changes in the same
 *      keystroke.
 *   2. `DepartmentHoursEditor` — the contracted week and the longest working day.
 *      Beside the ruler because it is the same KIND of thing: one departmental
 *      policy that every row below is judged against.
 *   3. `DepartmentLimitsEditor` — the daily duty cap, the run of days, and the
 *      pairs who must never share a shift. Beside the hours for the same reason.
 *   4. `StaffTable` — Name / Grade / FTE / Away, plus a per-row "More…" disclosure
 *      holding this person's own daily cap and their availability windows.
 *   5. `TaskTable` — Task / Who may lead / Days / Co-lead?, plus a per-row
 *      "More…" disclosure holding how often it repeats, how long a session takes,
 *      the multi-slot editor, continuity, a per-person quota and a category.
 *
 * WHY BOTH TABLES NOW HAVE A DISCLOSURE, AND WHAT KEEPS IT HONEST. The task row
 * already carries a name, four band chips, seven day chips, a co-lead toggle and
 * a remove button — eleven controls. The nine capabilities this phase reaches would
 * have made it twenty-five, on a row that has to fit a modal, and every one of them
 * is needed by a MINORITY of rows (the psychologists' monthly clinic, the
 * embryologists' block rotation, the lab's Saturday floor) while the first four are
 * needed by all of them. So the common case stays visible and the rest is one click
 * away, CLOSED by default. THREE rules keep that from hiding something that matters:
 *
 *   • a row whose hidden cells are SET says so in a summary line under its name, in
 *     the words of the setting rather than a bare dot;
 *   • a row whose hidden cells are WRONG opens itself and refuses to fold;
 *   • a control whose value the mapper would DROP is not rendered at all — the cell
 *     says where the decision moved to instead. That is why slot mode replaces the
 *     band chips, the co-lead toggle AND the continuity toggle, and why monthly mode
 *     replaces the day strip.
 *
 * EVERY NEW CONTROL STATES ITS DEFAULT AS A PLACEHOLDER AND EMITS NOTHING WHILE IT
 * IS BLANK. That is not politeness: the engine treats a STATED value as intent, and
 * two of these fields switch a whole model on by being mentioned at all
 * (`staff.windows` bounds everybody's eligibility in time; `task.quota` compiles a
 * floor or a ceiling). A helpfully prefilled `2` in the daily-cap box would be a
 * department declaring a policy it never discussed.
 *
 * ⚠️ SANDBOX ONLY. `RosterView` renders this in place of the two textareas when
 * `isDemo` is true, and renders the textareas exactly as before when it is not.
 * Nothing in this file imports Firestore, and nothing in it can write anything.
 *
 * NO STATE LIVES HERE. Every row, every band bound and every error comes in as a
 * prop and every edit goes out as a callback, so the one source of truth is
 * `RosterView`'s state and the one validator is
 * `buildDemoRosterV2ConfigFromTables`. A local copy of a cell's value here would
 * be a second, divergent answer to "what will be generated".

//
// MOST PEOPLE WHO OPEN THIS WILL OPEN IT ON A PHONE. A task row carries a name,
// four band chips, seven day chips, a co-lead toggle, a disclosure and a remove
// button; a staff row carries five fields and a disclosure. Neither fits in 375px,
// and the two `overflow-x-auto` wrappers that used to hold them meant the answer on
// a phone was "scroll sideways until you find the column you wanted" — a table
// nobody can read one row of at a time.
//
// BELOW `sm:` EVERY ROW IS A CARD. The `<table>` becomes `display:block`, the header
// row is hidden, each `<tr>` is a bordered block and each `<td>` is a full-width
// block with its column's name printed above the control. From `sm:` up every one of
// those declarations is reverted and the elements are a real table again, so the
// desktop layout is what it always was.
//
// THERE IS ONE MARKUP TREE, and that is the whole design. The obvious alternative —
// a `<div>` card list beside the `<table>`, one hidden at each breakpoint — is TWO
// renderers for one row, and this file's discipline is that a second renderer
// eventually disagrees with the first about which controls a row has. So the switch
// is CSS only: the column headings live in one object that both the `<th>`s and the
// in-card labels read, and every control, `aria-label`, `id`/`htmlFor` pairing and
// error line exists exactly once in the tree.
//
// THE IN-CARD LABEL IS NOT A SECOND ACCESSIBLE NAME. It is `aria-hidden`, and every
// field keeps the `aria-label` it already had — otherwise a screen reader would read
// the column heading and then the field name for one control.
//
// ⚠️ iOS SAFARI ZOOMS THE WHOLE PAGE when a focused input's text is under 16px, and
// it does not zoom back out: the visitor is left at 1.4× with the modal off-screen.
// So every `<input>`, `<select>` and `<textarea>` is 16px on a phone and drops back
// to the dense size from `sm:` up. Labels, helper text and headings may stay small —
// they are not focusable, so they cannot trigger it.

// --- 1. BAND BOUNDARIES: THE RULER --------------------------------------------
//
// This control used to be six number boxes — a min and a max for each of the three
// bands. Six independent numbers can express a GAP (AH12 in no band, so an AH12
// clinician is silently barred from every band-gated task), an OVERLAP, or a
// partition that stops short of either end of the scale; the only defence was
// `validateGradeBands` complaining afterwards.
//
// It is now ONE ruler with TWO dividers, because two dividers cannot express any
// of those states. The bands are DERIVED from where the dividers sit, so
// contiguity and full coverage of AH7–AH17 are arithmetic rather than assertions,
// and each divider's travel is bounded by its neighbour so that no band can be
// emptied or inverted. The constraint arithmetic lives in `rosterWizard.js`
// (`bandRulerModel`, `moveBandDivider`, `bandDividerLimits`) where it is pure and
// testable without a DOM; everything here is geometry and chrome.
//
// THE VALIDATION CALL STAYS. `buildDemoRosterV2ConfigFromTables` still runs
// `validateGradeBands`, and `reason` is still rendered below. That is belt and
// braces on purpose, and the braces are load-bearing:
//   • the state shape is unchanged and still holds raw strings, so a future caller
//     (or a restored session, or a fixture with a different `rules.bands`) can
//     still hand this component something that is not a partition — the ruler says
//     so rather than pretending, and the validator is what blocks Generate;
//   • the engine is the authority on what it will accept. A UI that stops
//     validating because its widget "cannot" produce a bad value is asserting
//     success instead of measuring it, which is the specific habit this repo's
//     post-mortem exists to break;
//   • the two agree today. If they ever stop agreeing, the message path is the
//     only thing that will say so out loud.
//
// WHAT IS NOT KEYBOARD-EXPRESSIBLE ANY MORE: typing an exact number. Arrow keys
// step by one grade and Home/End jump to the legal limits, which covers the eleven
// reachable positions in at most ten presses, but somebody who wants "senior
// starts at AH13" types nothing — they count. That is a real loss against the six
// boxes and it is recorded in the limits ledger rather than glossed over.

//
// BOTH BOXES START EMPTY, AND THAT IS THE FEATURE. The engine's hours model is
// OPT-IN on mention (`hoursModelRequested`): stating `rules.weeklyHours` switches
// it on even when the value typed is the default 42. So a prefilled 42 would turn
// hours on for every visitor who never thought about hours, and start reporting
// slots as unfilled against an 8.4-hour day nobody set. The boxes therefore show
// the number they WOULD apply as a placeholder and emit nothing until somebody
// types — and the caption says out loud that blank means "duties only".
//
// THE DERIVED DAY IS SHOWN, NOT RE-IMPLEMENTED. `derivedDailyHours` wraps the
// engine's own `defaultMaxHoursPerDay` over whatever the week box currently
// holds, so the placeholder in the second box is the figure the engine will
// actually use, and it follows the first box as it is typed.

//
// Three engine constraints that had NO control at all before this phase, and the
// audit (`ROSTER_QC_AUDIT_SURFACES.md` §3) is blunt about what that meant:
// `maxConcurrentPerDay` and `maxConsecutiveDays` arrived only via "Load example
// department", so a typed-in team could not set them; `rules.forbidPairs` had zero
// hits anywhere outside the engine and its own tests — validated, gated and audited,
// and unreachable by anybody.
//
// THEY LIVE UP HERE, BESIDE THE WORKING WEEK, because they are the same kind of fact:
// one departmental policy every row below is measured against. Putting the daily cap
// in a staff column would have implied it was per person — it is the DEFAULT that a
// person's own cap overrides, and the two want to be visibly a general rule and an
// exception to it.
//
// WHY THE PAIR PICKER IS TWO DROPDOWNS AND NOT A TEXT BOX. The engine refuses a pair
// naming somebody outside the staff pool, so free text would turn every typo into a
// blocked run with a message about spelling. Two selects over the names actually in
// the table cannot produce that state at all — and when the table is empty the
// control says so instead of offering two empty boxes.

/**
 * The daily duty cap, the run of days, and "never on the same shift".
 *
 * `inputs` is `{ maxConcurrentPerDay, maxConsecutiveDays, forbidPairs }` — two raw
 * strings and a list of `[a, b]` name pairs — `onChange(field, value)` is per field,
 * and `errors` is the mapper's `rulesErrors`.
 *
 * `staffNames` comes from the staff table two controls below. It is derived rather
 * than passed in from `RosterView` for the same reason `workingDays` is: it is a fact
 * about rows that are already in scope, and computing it once keeps one definition of
 * "who is in this department".
 *
 * THE ONLY LOCAL STATE IS WHICH TWO NAMES ARE CURRENTLY SELECTED IN THE PICKER, and
 * it is not an answer to "what will be generated" — nothing reads it but the Add
 * button — so it cannot diverge from one. The committed pairs live in `RosterView`
 * like every other value in this wizard.

/**
 * ONE PERSON'S HIDDEN HALF: how many duties they may hold in a day, and the dates
 * they are available at all.
 *
 * Rendered as its own full-width row under the person's row, not as extra columns,
 * for the reason the task drawer is: a window list is a LIST — three controls per
 * line — and there is no width in a table for it.
 *
 * THE UNION SENTENCE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COPY IN THIS FILE, and it is stated twice
 * because it is the one thing a roster master will get wrong. A person with ANY
 * window is eligible ONLY inside their windows. A window naming one task does not
 * "restrict that task and leave the rest alone" — it says "this task, in this range,
 * and nothing else at all". That is the engine's documented reading (section 0e(ii)),
 * it is the reading a placement or a block rotation actually needs, and it is not the
 * reading the words "availability window" suggest on their own.

/**
 * ⚠️ `readOnly` HERE FIXES A CONTROL THAT LIED FOR A WHOLE RELEASE.
 *
 *    `StaffTable` takes `readOnly` and honours it — it hides Add row and Remove —
 *    but this drawer never received it, so in live mode every input inside it, and
 *    an "Add availability window" button, stayed fully interactive. They could not
 *    work: live rows are a `useMemo` over the team's membership, while `onChange` is
 *    the SANDBOX row setter, which looks its id up in a different array and finds
 *    nothing. Clicking + was a guaranteed no-op, twice over.
 *
 *    A dead control is worse than an absent one. The roster master who reported it
 *    had been trying to limit themselves to some duties and reasonably concluded
 *    the feature was broken rather than that it was elsewhere. So live mode now
 *    SHOWS these values and says where they are set, the same way the table's own
 *    footnote does for grade and profession.

    /**
     * ⚠️ THE GUARD IS HERE, NOT ONLY IN THE `readOnly` ATTRIBUTES ON THE INPUTS.
     *
     *    A test proved why: `fireEvent.change` on a `readOnly` input fires `change`
     *    straight through, because the attribute is enforced by the BROWSER and not
     *    by the DOM. Live mode's `onChange` is the SANDBOX row setter, so a keystroke
     *    that got through would patch an array this table is not rendering — the
     *    exact defect this whole change set exists to fix, reintroduced by typing
     *    instead of by pressing a button.
     *
     *    So every write in this drawer goes through `patchRow`, which is a no-op in
     *    live mode. The inputs keep their `readOnly` attribute as well: that is what
     *    stops a real browser accepting the keystroke in the first place, and what
     *    tells a screen reader the field is not for editing.

/**
 * Name / Grade / FTE / Away / More…
 *
 * The grade dropdown's first option is BLANK and means "not recorded" — it is not
 * a default of AH7. Somebody with no grade recorded cannot lead a band-gated
 * task, and the engine says so by name in the warnings under the calendar. That
 * is the honest answer, and it is why there is no "assume junior" here.
 *
 * "0.6" IS NOT A CONTRACT ANYBODY RECOGNISES. An FTE is the number the engine
 * weighs fairness with, but nobody describes their own week that way: they work
 * three days. So each row also says what the figure MEANS, computed from the days
 * this department has actually ticked (`workingDays`) rather than from an assumed
 * five-day week — a lab that runs Saturdays would be told the wrong number by a
 * hard-coded 5. The number itself stays in the box, because it is what a payroll
 * record holds and it is what the load table reports against.
 *
 * THE DISCLOSURE IS NEW, and it holds the two things a person can carry that the
 * engine gates on and the table had no column for: their own daily duty cap, and the
 * dates they are available at all. Same three rules as the task table's — a summary
 * line when it is hiding something, forced open when what it hides is wrong, and no
 * control rendered whose value the mapper would drop.
 *
 * THE ONE PIECE OF STATE HERE is which rows are expanded, and it is deliberate for
 * exactly the reason the task table's is: it is not an answer to "what will be
 * generated", so it cannot diverge from one.
 */
/**
 * ⚠️ `readOnly` IS THE LIVE MODE, AND IT IS NOT A LESSER VERSION OF THE TABLE.
 *
 * In the sandbox the staff are TYPED, because there is no team to read. In a real
 * department they ARE the team — the member list maintained in the TEAM tab, where
 * adding somebody checks that their account exists and their address is on an
 * allowlisted domain. A second, editable copy here would let a roster master type
 * a name belonging to nobody and roster them, which is the display-name keying the
 * whole multi-team rebuild removed.
 *
 * So live mode shows the same rows, in the same table, and does not let them be
 * edited HERE. Each attribute is editable where it belongs, and the note under the
 * table says where.

 * Rendered as its own full-width row under the task's row, not as extra columns,
 * because a slot list is a LIST — three lines of two controls each — and there is
 * no width in a 6-column table for it. SIX GROUPS, each with a heading and a rule
 * above it, because a drawer holding a dozen controls with no grouping is the same
 * wall of inputs the visible row was protected from.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE ORDER A ROSTER MASTER ASKS THE QUESTIONS IN: when does it happen,
 * how long is it, who staffs it, does the same person keep it, how much of it does
 * one person get, and what is it called. It is also the order the mapper reports
 * errors in, so a refusal and the screen read the same way down the page.
 *
 * A MODE SWITCH HIDES THE CONTROLS IT WOULD OVERRIDE, and there are now two of them.
 * The engine refuses a task carrying `slots` beside `leads`, `coLeads`, `leadBands`
 * or `continuity: true`, and refuses `days` beside `recurrence`. So in slot mode the
 * band chips, the co-lead toggle and the continuity toggle are replaced by a sentence
 * saying where those decisions have moved to, and in monthly mode the day strip is.
 * Leaving them on screen, greyed or not, would be showing a control whose value the
 * mapper then drops — which is the shape of every defect in this repo's post-mortem.

 * Task / Who may lead / Days / Co-lead? / More…

 * from the CURRENT band boundaries on every render — so the row says
 * `AH13–AH17`, not `Senior/Principal`, which is the thing a roster master
 * actually checks against a payslip.
 *
 * Co-lead is a yes/no toggle rather than a count on purpose: `downloadCSV` and
 * `downloadICS` render exactly one co-lead, so a second one would be assigned by
 * the engine and then silently dropped from the exports this sandbox is showing
 * off. A shift that genuinely needs three people is a SLOT LIST instead, under
 * "More…", and the engine reports all of its people in `assignees`.
 *
 * WHICH ROWS ARE EXPANDED IS LOCAL STATE, and it is deliberate — the same exception
 * `StaffTable`'s disclosure and the ruler's `draggingRef` are, for the same reason:
 * it is not an answer to "what will be generated", so it cannot diverge from one.
 * Collapsing a row changes nothing about the roster: everything typed inside stays
 * in the row and stays in the config.

                                                at all without also admitting AH11.

                                                Unlike the chips it is shown in SLOT MODE too,
                                                because the engine composes a task's floor onto
                                                every slot. */}
