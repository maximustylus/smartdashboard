/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * THE SANDBOX, SIGNED IN, WITH NO TEAM — every view, nothing thrown
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * Demo mode has only ever been entered from two places: signed OUT, from the
 * welcome screen's DEMO tab, and by a member of the legacy ten-person directory
 * flipping the Live/Demo toggle. Both of those carry a `teamId`. The holding
 * screen now offers the sandbox to a THIRD kind of visitor — signed in, approved
 * by nobody, waiting to be added to a team — and that person has `teamId === null`
 * while `isDemo` is true, a combination no view had ever been rendered with.
 *
 * It is not a hypothetical: `teamPaths.assertTeamId` THROWS on null, deliberately,
 * because a path composed from a bad id writes into another department's data. So
 * any view that reaches a path builder before checking `isDemo` or `teamId` would
 * white-screen for exactly the audience the new door was built for — a colleague's
 * first minute with NEXUS.
 *
 * WHY THE REAL `teamPaths` IS USED HERE AND NOT A MOCK. The assertion this file
 * makes is "no path is composed", and a mocked builder that quietly returns a
 * string would make every test pass while proving nothing. The real module is the
 * detector: reaching it with a null id is a thrown error, and a thrown error in a
 * render is a failed test.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES AND DOES NOT CATCH, measured rather than assumed. Deleting
 * `FeedsView`'s `if (!teamId)` guard makes two of these tests fail, so the detector
 * works. Deleting `StaffLoadEditor`'s does NOT — its fetch loops over
 * `rosteredMembers`, and no team means no members, so the loop body never reaches
 * `loadPath` whether the guard is there or not. That guard is therefore pinned by
 * reading, not by this suite, and saying so is better than letting a green tick
 * imply otherwise. Guards written as `if (isDemo || !teamId)` are likewise only
 * half-exercised here: `isDemo` short-circuits first in this state.
 *
 * `RosterView` is absent on purpose — `RosterView.demo.test.jsx` already renders
 * it in exactly this state (it mocks `NexusContext` to `isDemo: true` and never
 * provides a team, so `useTeam` falls back to `teamId: null`) and additionally
 * asserts that no Firestore call is made at all. This file covers the rest.

 * `rosteredMembers`, a new `[]` each render is a new dependency, the effect refires,
 * `setLoads` re-renders, and round it goes. That was the MOCK's fault, not the
 * component's — the real `TeamContext` returns a module-level frozen `INERT` outside
 * a provider and a `useMemo`'d value inside one, so both are referentially stable
 * and neither loops. Mirroring that here keeps this file testing the app rather than
 * testing a defect in its own scaffolding.
