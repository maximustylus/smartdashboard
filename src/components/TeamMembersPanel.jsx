/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * TEAM MEMBERS — WHERE A LEAD ADDS AND REMOVES THEIR OWN PEOPLE
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * This screen is the second half of the onboarding story the rebuild promised: the
 * owner approves a team ONCE, and after that the lead runs it without going back to
 * the owner for every colleague. Until `inviteMember` and `removeMember` existed
 * there was no second half — `firestore.rules` denies membership `create` and
 * `delete` outright and deferred both to Cloud Functions that had not been written,
 * so an approved team could never grow past the one person in it.
 *
 * ── WHAT REPLACED WHAT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `TEAM_DIRECTORY` in `src/utils/index.js` — ten people in an array — plus
 * `directory()` and `directoryNames()` in the rules, plus the five-name exclusion
 * list in `AdminPanel.jsx`. Onboarding one clinician used to mean editing source,
 * editing the rules and redeploying them. It is now this form.
 *
 * ── WHY THE LIST IS READ DIRECTLY BUT THE CHANGES ARE NOT ────────────────────
 *
 * `firestore.rules` grants `get, list` on `teams/{id}/members` to any member of that
 * team — the roster, the swap picker and the load table are all built from it — so
 * `TeamContext` already holds a live list and this screen renders that rather than
 * fetching its own. Writing is the opposite: `create` and `delete` are denied to
 * every client, because a lead able to mint a membership for an arbitrary uid could
 * invent one, register it, and sign in as a member of a team nobody put them in.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS SCREEN IS NOT THE SECURITY BOUNDARY. Hiding the form from a non-lead is
 *    presentation. `readTeamContext` in `functions/index.js` re-reads the caller's
 *    membership from the database on every call and refuses anybody who is not a
 *    lead OF THAT TEAM — that refusal is the control.
