/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * ROSTER VIEW — P8.3 (no native dialogs) and M12 (duplicate swap requests)
 * ==============================================================================
 * Runner: Vitest + @testing-library/react (jsdom)
 * Run:    npx vitest run src/components/RosterView.alerts.test.jsx
 *
 * Two claims are pinned here, both of which the repository has previously made
 * and not kept:
 *
 *   P8.3 — the v1.5 release notes say "native browser alerts replaced with
 *   custom-branded confirmation modals". `RosterView.jsx` falsified that with
 *   eight `window.alert` calls. `window.alert`, `window.confirm` and
 *   `window.prompt` are all stubbed with spies here and asserted NEVER called,
 *   across every path in this view that used to raise one — so the claim can
 *   only become false again by turning this file red.
 *
 *   M12 — `addDoc` was unconditional, so pressing Submit twice on one shift
 *   wrote two independently-acceptable PENDING documents. The guard is asserted
 *   twice: as a pure signature function, and end-to-end against the mocked
 *   `addDoc` in LIVE mode.
 *
 * Unlike `RosterView.demo.test.jsx`, this file drives BOTH universes: the demo
 * flag is a `vi.hoisted` box the context mock reads, so live-mode behaviour
 * (which is where `addDoc` actually happens) is reachable.
 * ==============================================================================
