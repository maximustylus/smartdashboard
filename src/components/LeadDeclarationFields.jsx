/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * LEAD DECLARATION — the three fields, in one place
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * Institution, department and profession: what somebody claiming to run a team has
 * to say before an administrator can approve them.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHY THIS IS A COMPONENT AND NOT JSX IN TWO SCREENS ────────────────────
 *
 * It is asked in two places now, and they are reached by different people at
 * different moments:
 *
 *   · `WelcomeScreen` — at registration, by somebody who knows they run a team
 *     and ticks the box.
 *   · `AccessGate` — later, by somebody who registered as staff and turns out to
 *     lead a department. Before this existed they had no route at all: the
 *     declaration was written inside the sign-up handler and nowhere else, so
 *     registering without the box ticked left them `awaiting-invite` for ever,
 *     with a screen offering "Check again" and "Sign out".
 *
 * The VALIDATION and the WRITE SHAPE were already shared — `validateLeadDeclaration`
 * and `buildLeadRequest` in `accessPolicy.js`. Only the inputs were duplicated, and
 * duplicated inputs are how a fourth field gets added to one screen and not the
 * other: the request then validates, writes, and is missing something an approver
 * needs, from one door and not the other. This repository has that failure
 * already, under `CP9`, and does not need a second one.
 *
 * Presentational and fully controlled. It holds no state, performs no write, and
 * knows nothing about Firestore — the two callers own all of that, because they
 * disagree about what happens next: one is creating an account, the other is
 * amending an existing one.
