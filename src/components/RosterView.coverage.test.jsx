/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * ROSTER VIEW — ONE-TAP COVER, END TO END (component tests)
 * ==============================================================================
 * Runner: Vitest + @testing-library/react (jsdom)
 * Run:    npx vitest run src/components/RosterView.coverage.test.jsx
 *
 * A colleague asking you to cover a clinical shift used to arrive as a chat
 * message: `AuraPulseBot` force-opened the wellbeing assistant with a
 * `ROSTER_ALERT` bubble and the Accept button lived inside the conversation. That
 * surface has moved into the roster — a badge on the shift, an inline card, one
 * tap — and this file is the gate on the move having kept every guarantee v1.6.1
 * paid for. Nobody can log in and click through it before it ships; these
 * assertions are the verification.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED HERE:
 *
 *   1. A PENDING request aimed at the signed-in user renders IN THE ROSTER, with
 *      the asker, the duty, the day and the reason — and a badge in the calendar
 *      square the shift is in.
 *   2. ACCEPTING RUNS THE VERIFIED SEQUENCE, IN ORDER: read the roster →
 *      write ONE day → READ THE DOCUMENT BACK → find the substitution in it →
 *      and only THEN `status: 'APPROVED'`. The order is asserted off a call log,
 *      not inferred, and the success sentence quotes the read-back document.
 *   3. MECHANICAL SUBSTITUTION. The covering colleague takes exactly the role the
 *      requester held; the co-lead is untouched, the other shift that day is
 *      untouched, and a pre-6-May legacy shift is upgraded on write.
 *   4. A MUTATION THAT MATCHES NOTHING LEAVES THE REQUEST PENDING. Two separate
 *      failures are driven: the roster no longer supports the swap (no roster
 *      write at all), and the write does not land (no `APPROVED`). Both name the
 *      binding constraint on screen and leave the request answerable.
 *   5. DECLINING DOES NOT TOUCH THE ROSTER DOCUMENT.
 *   6. DEMO MODE WRITES NOTHING AND READS NOTHING — no listener, no `query`, no
 *      `collection`, no card.
 *   7. M8 SURVIVED THE MOVE: a `permission-denied` on the coverage listener is
 *      visible, and says the card is empty because it could not be loaded.
 *
 * `planSwapApplication` / `findAppliedSwapShift` are NOT re-tested here — they are
 * locked, and `auraEngine.swap.test.js` owns them. What is tested is that this
 * view calls them in the right order and reports only what came back.
