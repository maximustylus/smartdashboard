/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * THE CONFIGURATION WIZARD IS A NUMBERED SEQUENCE (component tests)
 * ==============================================================================
 * Runner: Vitest + @testing-library/react (jsdom)
 * Run:    npx vitest run src/components/RosterView.steps.test.jsx
 *
 * The wizard's panels were a stack of similarly-styled cards. Nothing told a
 * first-time reader that they were ordered, that Staff comes before Tasks for a
 * reason, or how much was still below the fold. The roster owner asked for "a
 * number and a line ... so that it's logical and sequential".
 *
 * WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR, specifically: the numbers are DERIVED from
 * `WIZARD_STEPS`, not written at each call site, and the panels they number live
 * in TWO different files (`RosterView.jsx` has steps 1–2, and
 * `RosterDemoWizardTables.jsx` has 3–7). That split is exactly how a numbering
 * scheme rots: someone inserts a panel in one file and the other file's numbers
 * silently become wrong, or two panels end up both claiming to be step 4. So the
 * assertions here are about the sequence as a WHOLE — that the badges read
 * 1..N with no gaps and no repeats, across both files, in DOM order — rather than
 * about any single badge saying what it should.
 *
 * They also pin the two things a reader would notice if they broke: live mode is
 * NOT numbered (its wizard is a different, shorter thing), and the wizard does not
 * gain a horizontal scrollbar on a phone from the badge gutter.
