// is a system prompt the caller can replace — and the endpoint it was sent to,
// `chatWithAura`, accepted up to 8,000 characters of it without authentication.

// It now lives in `functions/index.js` beside `communityAck`, which takes no
// caller-supplied prompt at all. Nothing here needs it: this component sends the
// domain, the answer and the prior answers, and receives one sentence back.

// completion and error messages, which badged the final plan with whatever
// domain happens to be last (`healthier_sg`) — so those messages carry no
// `step` now, and the constant had no remaining reader. Deleted rather than
// corrected: a count nothing consumes is a comment waiting to go stale again.
