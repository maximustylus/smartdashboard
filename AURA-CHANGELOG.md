# AURA — changelog

The **AURA engine version** is a separate internal version tracking the agent's capability
tier. It moves independently of the app version in `package.json` and is **not** changed by
an app release. `CHANGELOG.md:12` is the source of that rule; this file is the history it
refers to.

> ⚠️ **COVERAGE GAP — this file records no AURA work after 2026-08-28, and the engine changed
> materially after that.** Shipped but unrecorded below: `functions/modelAvailability.cjs`
> (2026-09-05, the second half of `AU30` — a rotated key would otherwise have taken AURA down),
> `functions/workloadIntent.cjs` (a server-side card discard), `src/utils/reworkNote.js`,
> five `AURA_SYSTEM_PROMPT` rules (`AU31`–`AU35`), `src/utils/pulseKeys.js` `pulseStats`
> (`AU13`) and `functions/responseParser.cjs` (`AU18`). `AURA-TODO.md` carries all of them
> with evidence; this file does not. That is exactly the failure its own opening paragraph
> names — *"a changelog that is not written when the work lands is a changelog that is wrong"* —
> recurring. Flagged 2026-09-15 rather than back-filled, because writing these entries after
> the fact is the thing the file warns against.

**Currently `v2.3`.** The app is `v2.10.0` at the time of this snapshot (it is **v2.14.0** as of 2026-09-15) *(as of 2026-09-03; `package.json` is the
source, this line is a snapshot — it read `v2.1.3` for nine roster-only releases).*

⚠️ **Open question for the owner (2026-09-03):** the batch below was headed *"Unreleased —
v2.3.1"* and has shipped, but nothing was bumped — `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`,
`.claude/agents/version-steward.md` and the info card all still say the engine tier is
`v2.3`. Either the tier is `v2.3.1` and those four lines move together, or the batch is
documentation-and-hardening within `v2.3` and the heading below is renamed. Not decided here.

> ### ⚠️ How to read this file
>
> This changelog was created on **2026-08-23**, alongside `AURA-POSTMORTEM.md` (removed
> 2026-09-06; readable at tag `docs-archive-2026-09-06`, as is `ROSTER_POSTMORTEM.md`,
> cited below). The repository had no AURA-specific changelog
> before, so **everything below `v2.3` is reconstructed** — from `CHANGELOG.md`'s own
> reconstructed entries (`[1.0.0]`–`[1.4.0]`, themselves rebuilt from the README) and from
> the surviving code. Reconstructed entries are marked as such and should be read as *"the
> best account available"*, not as a record written at the time.
>
> Where a historical claim is now known to be false, it is **struck through and annotated
> with the finding id**, not deleted. *"This used to be claimed"* is what stops the same
> claim being made again.

## ~~Unreleased~~ Shipped — the **v2.3.1** batch, not v2.4 · 2026-08-23 → 2026-08-28 · merged to `main` 2026-08-28/29 (PRs #2–#4), live since app v2.1.x

⚠️ **This section said *"Nothing yet. Every row is `OPEN`"* until 2026-08-24, by which point
two days of remediation had shipped.** A changelog that is not written when the work lands is
a changelog that is wrong, and it was. What follows is reconstructed from the commits, not
from memory, and each line cites one.

**Still v2.3.1-equivalent, deliberately.** An engine version bump belongs to a change in
capability *tier*. Everything below **corrects what the current tier already claimed to do**,
which is the opposite of a new tier. Bumping to v2.4 because a lot of work happened would be
the kind of number-moving this file exists to stop.

### The prompts (`AURA-TODO.md` P7) — `88af00f`

- **`AU6` + `AU7`** — MODE 3 now asks for the **display name** as `target_doc`. The prompt
  asked for a uid while `memberUidByName` looked up a name, so the feature only worked when
  the model **disobeyed** its own schema.
- **`AU19`** — `requiredFields` throws instead of warning, and `db_workload` is in the list.
  It was the one field leading to a database write and the only one absent from the check
  that was not checking.
- **`AU20`** — temperature keyed on the server-held `personaId`, not a substring of caller
  text. Default 0.7 → **0.4**.
- **`AU28`** — persona text moved out of the user turn and into `systemInstruction`, held in
  `functions/personas.cjs`. The caller `prompt` is still accepted and is no longer labelled
  `CONTEXT/OVERRIDE:`. **The persona wording is unchanged, word for word.**
- **`AN5`** — the analysis asks for 600–900 + 200–350 words against a budget raised 2,048 →
  **4,096**, with a test that computes the ask from the prompt.
- **`AN3`** — no institution is hardcoded in the analysis prompt.
- `functions/promptContract.test.js`: 33 assertions, **15 of which fail on the pre-P7 code**.

### The guardrails (`AURA-TODO.md` P8) — 2026-08-24

The owner's sixteen rules, in [`AURA-GUARDRAILS.md`](AURA-GUARDRAILS.md) and
`functions/guardrails.cjs`.

- **Rule 12 / `AU16` (half)** — which model answered is **recorded**: on every chat and
  analysis response, in the .docx export footer, in the `smart_database` audit row and in the
  archived year-end report. It was recorded nowhere, and `resolveModel()` silently falls back
  between five models, so it was not recoverable afterwards either. ~~⚠️ The **cache reset**
  half of `AU16` is still open.~~ *Both halves closed the same day — see the entry below
  and `AURA-TODO.md` 1.4 / 8.2; this line was the stale one.*
- **P1** — the wellbeing report carries a declared *"Assumptions, gaps and unverified items"*
  block, and when the model omits one the report says the model declared nothing rather than
  claiming there was nothing to declare.
- **Rule 15** — *content is data, never instruction* now reaches `processFeedPost`, which
  classifies staff-authored text and acts on its own verdict and had no such line.
- `functions/guardrails.test.js`: 72 assertions, **10 of which fail on the pre-guardrail
  code**.

⚠️ **Ten of the sixteen rules are asserted to be *present in the prompt*, never *followed by
the model*.** §B of `AURA-GUARDRAILS.md` is the split. Do not read a green suite as
compliance.

### The closing sweep — 2026-08-24, engineering queue to zero

Everything below shipped on branch `aura` the same day, steward-reviewed, with the
test count moving **3,015 → 3,232 across 86 files** and the rules emulator at
**140 passed, 0 failed**:

- **Cost and abuse closed** — `AU14` one per-uid budget (120/hr) across all three
  Gemini callables; `AU15`+`AU17`-log attachment bounds (`attachmentRules.cjs`);
  `AU16` both halves (provenance recorded AND the fallback model no longer pinned);
  `AN10` FCM chunked at 500 with the result read.
- **The quick five** — `AU27` demo fences on both `smart_database` writes; `AU4`
  `mmm_yyyy` periods at guard, caller and `teamPaths`; `AU9`/`AU10`/`AU24` the
  wellbeing sanitiser (`wellbeingLog.js`, 29 tests) replacing `clampEnergy`.
- **The intelligence layer's last rows** — `AN6` client timeout 60s (was a false
  "matches the backend" 300s); `AN8` an empty report throws instead of archiving
  *"No private report generated."* as the year-end record; `AN13` the NRIC/FIN
  fence on comments (rules + client, parity-tested) and `AN12`'s deterministic
  code half in `processFeedPost`.
- **`AU12` and the `AC` batch** — pulse board keyed by uid with self-migrating
  writes (`pulseKeys.js`, 15 tests, both writers delete every case variant);
  `AC5` `parseClinicalData` extracted VERBATIM to `clinicalParse.js` and finally
  imported by tests; `AC6`/`AC7` the completion try restructured (progress kept on
  failure); `AC8` resolved by CORRECTING the finding (a client abort cannot stop a
  Cloud Function); `AC9`/`AC10` dead tolerance deleted; `AC12` a live region on
  the public chat; `AC13`/`AC14` stable keys and `TOTAL_STEPS` deleted.
- **The steward round** — the NRIC fence's first cut let a multi-line NRIC through
  (RE2's `.` does not cross newlines) while its JS mirror reported agreement;
  fixed with `(?s)`, and the ACCEPTANCE moved to the real engine: the emulator
  fails exactly the four multi-line cases on the pre-fix rules. `AC16` filed and
  closed same day (the completion latch).
- **`AU3`'s deferred half** — the `hasOnly` backstop on the workload document,
  riding the same rules deploy `AN13` requires, emulator-verified.

~~⚠️ **Deploy note, unchanged:** rules → functions → hosting, in that order, after
the owner's 20-turn read. Nothing above is live until the merge.~~ **Merged to `main`
2026-08-28/29 (PRs #2–#4) and live since app v2.1.x.** ~~The 20-turn read did not run
first; it is still owed~~ — **CORRECTED 2026-09-15: it ran on 2026-09-05**, three live runs,
result in `docs/P8.8-owner-read-2026-09-05.md`. The 18 owner verdicts remain unsigned
(`AURA-TODO.md` P8.8).

### Before that — `c2b45d9`, `a99ffa6`, `addf3a5`, `e3b6bb9`

`AN1` `AN2` `AN3` (colleagues' job grades out of the public bundle, the analysis over the
caller's own team), `AN4` (the analysis endpoint was unauthenticated), `AU2` `AU3` `AU22`
`AU25`, `AC1` `AC2` `AC15` (the PAVS parser). Evidence for each is in
[`AURA-TODO.md`](AURA-TODO.md).

### Transparency — the IMDA chatbot info card · 2026-08-27

**Still v2.3.1-equivalent: documentation, not capability.** NEXUS will align with the IMDA
*Transparency Guidelines for Generative AI Chatbots* (published 20 July 2026), and the
first artefact is drafted: [`docs/AURA-CHATBOT-INFO-CARD.md`](docs/AURA-CHATBOT-INFO-CARD.md),
a consolidated card for the three generative surfaces after the guidelines' Annex B sample —
capabilities and prohibitions, safety and reliability (qualitative only; nothing quantitative
exists to cite), data practices per surface, and reporting channels, with the known gaps
(`AU17`, `P8.8`, no age assurance) declared in the card body rather than omitted. The card
~~is a **draft pending owner sign-off** (`AURA-TODO.md` 9.1)~~ was signed off the next day —
see *2026-08-28* below. The roster engine is
deliberately outside the card: no model, no card row, per `AU1`.

**Surfaced the same day (P9.2/P9.3, closed with evidence in `AURA-TODO.md`):** the app
serves the document verbatim at `/aura-info` (a `?raw` import of the markdown — one source,
its own lazy chunk), a dismissible first-use safety banner in the staff assistant, the
public safety statement beside `PathwaySelection`'s collection notice, and persistent info
icons in both chat headers. 14 new tests across four files. ⚠️ The first cut of the card
reproduced the `SECURITY.md` contact address, and **`an14.bundle.test.js` refused the
bundle** — the seven staff addresses are guarded out of `dist/`, and a transparency page is
not an exemption. The card now cites `SECURITY.md` instead of embedding the address, the
conflict is the card's own gap item 9, and the decision (a dedicated public support address,
or the in-app reporter as the only public channel) is `AURA-TODO.md` 9.5. The test was not
weakened.

**Steward audit of the batch, same day (card → v0.3):** 21 load-bearing card claims
CONFIRMED against source; three documentation errors found and corrected in place — the
card claimed chat history dies on panel close (**false**: nothing clears it, not even
sign-out — opened as **`AU29`**, high, owner's queue, and the card now states the true
behaviour and the shared-terminal mitigation); a "91 emulator checks" citation the repo had
superseded twice (now 140, in the card and the README both); and `AN13` described as an
accepted gap after it had closed (now described as the NRIC/FIN fence it is). Two Evidence
columns in P9 gained honest caveats: the `/aura-info` route registration is hand-verified,
not regression-guarded, and a `/individuals/chat` deep link bypasses the public first-use
statement. The card also gained the guardrail-P3 source table (claim, source, verification
status) so the 9.1 sign-off reads over pre-verified claims.

**2026-08-28 — the card signed off, and `AU29` closed the next day it existed.** The owner
read draft v0.3 in full and approved it; the card is **v1.0, in effect**, with the named
sign-off Rule 12 requires. On the owner's instruction the same session closed `AU29`:
`handleLogout` now clears the root-provider transcript, and the panel resets its whole
session on any change of signed-in identity (ref-guarded so mounting and same-uid
re-renders never wipe) — 4 tests in `AuraPulseBot.au29.test.jsx`, including that a
colleague's fresh session cannot resurface the previous person's line. 9.5 decided in
direction (a dedicated non-personal support address; mailbox pending) and left open on
exactly that. The IMDA encouraged minimum is met in the codebase; it reaches users at
deploy.

**2026-08-28, later the same day — `AU30`, found live on the owner's screen.** Every
`chatWithAura` call was 500ing in production: the Gemini key is free-tier, ListModels
shows `gemini-2.5-pro` to every key, and the free tier grants that model **zero** generate
quota — so `resolveModel()` picked a model no call could use and cached it, and the raw
upstream refusal (quota metrics, billing URLs) was forwarded to the browser console (row
6.6's middle element, demonstrated in production). Fixed the same day: `modelQuota.cjs`
(pure — quota detection, per-container demotion with a 30-minute TTL, next-usable
selection, the clean client sentence) and one `geminiGenerate` helper that all four
callables route through, retrying a quota-refused request once on the next usable model.
Provenance records whichever model answered. 17 new tests; functions suite 440 passing.
Card updated to v1.1 (§1 only). The free tier itself is untouched — the fallback lands on
flash models with modest free quotas, and a paid tier remains the owner's decision.

### What would justify a real v2.4, if the owner decides them that way

- `AU8` — content-gated assessment instead of turn-count-gated
- `AU11` — a validated memory model instead of raw output re-injection
- `AN7` — a reviewed confidentiality split instead of an unreviewed one

## v2.3 — *"proactive database middleware"* · reconstructed

Recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` under app `[1.4.0]`, reconstructed from the README.

**Claimed at the time:**

- **Engine upgrade to v2.3:** from reactive conversational bot to proactive
  database-middleware agent.
- ~~**Autonomous Roster Mediation:** AURA listens to Firebase collections via live
  snapshots and executes peer-to-peer shift-swap matrix rewrites.~~
  > **False as written.** `ROSTER_POSTMORTEM.md` Block **A1** found the rewrite never
  > actually happened. The surface was removed in app v1.10.0; `README.md:18` carries a
  > 2026-08-15 correction. ~~⚠️ `README.md:265` still makes the original claim~~ **CORRECTED 2026-09-15: the README no longer carries it** — the 2026-09-10 rewrite removed it, and `grep` for the phrasing returns nothing. `AU23` is `DONE`. The claim — the
  > correction was applied to one line and not the other. **`AU23`.**
- **Native File Export:** Markdown compiled to `.docx` Blob objects, downloaded from the
  chat UI. *(Still true.)*
- **Data Entry Payload Expansion:** the LLM schema extended to extract operational
  parameters from natural language and generate database commit interfaces.
  > This is MODE 3. What shipped with it: a language model choosing a Firestore collection
  > *and* a document id (`CHANGELOG.md:249`). The collection was later allowlisted and the
  > person resolved through the member list — but the **value** was never validated
  > (**`AU2`**), the **field** is still model-chosen (**`AU3`**), and the personal branch
  > cannot work as instructed (**`AU6`**).
- **Technical Debt Resolution:** iOS Safari phantom-click z-index fix; sandbox Cloud
  Function schema-mismatch crashes patched.

**Known now, not then:** `AU2` `AU3` `AU5` `AU6` `AU7` `AU19` `AU22`.

---

## v2.2 and earlier — *"legacy IDC App"* · reconstructed

Recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` under app `[1.0.0]`–`[1.3.0]`, reconstructed from the README.

- **Early AURA Integration:** a baseline conversational agent using Motivational
  Interviewing (OARS) with basic administrative query routing.
- **Wellbeing Analytics:** Pulse tracking and the daily Social Battery heatmap.
  > The heatmap is `teams/{id}/pulse/{period}`, and AURA still writes it **keyed by display
  > name** — the one place the v2.0 uid migration did not reach. **`AU12`.**
- ~~**Auto-Rostering Framework:** initial "zero-conflict" scheduling logic.~~
  > `ROSTER_POSTMORTEM.md` **E1**: *"zero-conflict"* truthfully means *"cannot double-book
  > by construction"* — a property of the cyclic rotation, not a safety guarantee. **And
  > this is the roster engine, which contains no AI** — it is in this file only because it
  > carries the AURA name. See **`AU1`**.

## Timeline of what changed AURA without changing its version

The engine version has read `v2.3` throughout. These are the changes that actually altered
what AURA can do, drawn from `CHANGELOG.md` and `COMMUNITY_TODO.md`:

| When | What | Effect on AURA |
|---|---|---|
| app v1.10.0 | The `ROSTER_ALERT` chat surface removed | AURA stopped force-opening for coverage requests; the roster became the surface. ~~Two README lines still describe the old behaviour~~ **CORRECTED 2026-09-15: neither survives the 2026-09-10 README rewrite** (**`AU23`** is `DONE`). |
| 2026-08-19 | `firestore.rules` deployed and enforcing | The first real boundary under MODE 3's writes. `CHANGELOG.md:249` calls the path enumeration *"the single largest security win"* the rules file has. |
| `CP6` | `publicTriageChat` closed — 145 lines, unauthenticated, no callers | One of three open AI endpoints shut. |
| `CP6`/`CP7` | `communityAck` created; `chatWithAura` gained `request.auth` | The public screening stopped calling the staff-facing prompt. ⚠️ `generateSmartAnalysis` was **not** given the same check — **`AN4`**. |
| `CP7` | `rateLimit.js` + App Check shipped (inert) on `communityAck` | Ceilings on the 200-token endpoint. ⚠️ Not on the 8192-token one — **`AU14`**. |
| `CP6`/0.2 | `demoAura.js` written | The sandbox stopped calling Gemini and became genuinely local. ⚠️ Its `db_workload` shape does not match the live one, so the demo card never renders — **`AU22`**. |
| v2.0.0 | Multi-team migration; everything keyed by uid | AURA's paths became team-scoped. ⚠️ The pulse board (**`AU12`**) and the MODE 3 prompt schema (**`AU7`**) were not converted. |
| v2.1.0 | Grade moved to `teams/{id}/grades/{uid}`, list denied | Pay grade left the membership document. ⚠️ A hardcoded copy of six people's grades remained in a client component and ships in the bundle — **`AN1`**. |
| 2026-08-23 | This post-mortem set | 51 findings. **0 fixed.** |

## Versioning rules for this file

1. **The AURA version is not the app version**, and an app release must not bump it.
   (`CHANGELOG.md:752`.)
2. **A bump means the capability tier changed** — what AURA can do, not how well it does
   it. Correcting a defect in v2.3 behaviour stays v2.3.
3. **A claim that turns out to be false is struck through and annotated with its finding
   id, never deleted.** Two entries above are already in that state, and both were found
   because somebody read the README rather than the code.
4. **Entries are evidence-bearing**, matching [`AURA-TODO.md`](AURA-TODO.md)'s ledger rule:
   a line saying a thing was fixed carries the test count, the grep, or the sha.
