/**
 * ==============================================================================
 * TEAM #1 — THE MIGRATION MANIFEST
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * Exactly who becomes a member of the first team, and with what role. This is the
 * INPUT to `scripts/migrate-to-teams.cjs`, held as its own file for one reason:
 * the migration writes real memberships to real clinical data, and "who is in the
 * team" is a decision the owner made, not something a script should infer from a
 * hardcoded array it happens to find in `src/utils/index.js`.
 *
 * A reviewer should be able to read this file alone and know exactly what the
 * migration will create.
 *
 * ── THE DECISION, AND WHEN IT CHANGED ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first answer was "all ten directory members, keeping their current roles" —
 * that preserved today's access exactly and changed nothing at cutover. The owner
 * then narrowed it: **Ashik, Mini and Evelyn are not in team #1.**
 *
 * ⚠️ THAT IS A REVOCATION, NOT A FILTER, AND IT SHOULD BE READ AS ONE. Those three
 *    can still sign in — the domain allowlist admits `@kkh.com.sg` and
 *    `@singhealth.com.sg` — but with no membership they reach the "nobody has added
 *    you to a team yet" holding screen and see no roster, no wellbeing data and no
 *    feed. Today they can read all three. If any of them asks why NEXUS stopped
 *    working, this is why, and a lead can invite them back in seconds without a
 *    deploy.
 *
 * Benny is NOT in that list and stays — he is the **Head of Service**, and was kept
 * deliberately when the other three stakeholders were dropped. Stated explicitly
 * because "remove the viewers" would have been the tidier-sounding rule, is not what
 * was asked for, and would have removed the person the service reports to.
 *
 * ── TWO INDEPENDENT FACTS, NOT ONE ROLE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   role      WHAT YOU MAY DO
 *     lead      configure the roster, generate it, invite and remove members
 *     staff     answer coverage requests, log wellbeing, hold duties
 *     viewer    read the roster and nothing else
 *
 *   rostered  WHETHER YOU HOLD CLINICAL DUTIES
 *     true      appears in the staff pool the generator draws from, and in the
 *               clinical-load table
 *     false     does not, however senior or however much they configure
 *
 * ⚠️ THESE WERE ONE FIELD AND THAT WAS A MODELLING ERROR, corrected here rather
 *    than worked around. In a ten-person department they coincided closely enough
 *    to look like one thing, so `role` was used for both and the clinical-load table
 *    excluded people with `role !== 'viewer'`.
 *
 *    NISA IS THE COUNTEREXAMPLE. She is the department's administrator AND its
 *    ROSTER MASTER — she builds the roster every week — so she must be able to
 *    configure and generate, which makes her a `lead`. She carries no clinical load,
 *    so she must not appear in the staff pool the generator draws from, or the
 *    engine will hand her duties. As a `viewer` she could not roster; as a `lead`
 *    under the old single-field model she would have been rostered. Neither is true,
 *    and no amount of choosing between them makes it true.
 *
 *    ALIF IS THE SAME PROOF IN REVERSE: a lead who DOES practise. He configures the
 *    roster and holds duties in it.
 *
 *    So team #1 alone contains both counterexamples, and no single field survives
 *    them. `role !== 'viewer'` puts the roster master in the staff pool;
 *    `role === 'staff'` takes the roster away from her AND drops the service lead
 *    out of his own rota. Choosing between them harder does not make either right.
 *
 * ── EMAIL IS THE JOIN KEY, AND ONLY FOR THE MIGRATION ────────────────────────
 *
 * The migration resolves each address to a Firebase Auth uid via the Admin SDK and
 * writes the membership under that uid. Email appears here because it is the only
 * identifier that exists in BOTH the old world and the new one; after the migration
 * nothing routes by it. An address with no auth account is REPORTED AND SKIPPED,
 * never guessed at — a membership under a uid nobody holds is a document that can
 * never be read or cleaned up.

     * A LEAD WHO ALSO PRACTISES — confirmed by the owner, and the exact case that
     * makes `role` and `rostered` two fields rather than one. He configures and
     * generates the roster AND holds duties in it.
     *
     * ⚠️ THIS CORRECTS A HARDCODED LIST THAT WAS OUT OF DATE. I first set this
     *    `false` on the evidence of `LIVE_ROSTER_DEFAULTS.staff` in `auraEngine.js`,
     *    which lists ['Brandon', 'Ying Xian', 'Derlinder', 'Fadzlynn'] and does not
     *    include him. The owner corrected it: that constant was simply stale, which
     *    is precisely the failure a hardcoded team produces — nobody edits the array
     *    when the department changes, and the array quietly stops describing it.
     *
     *    The consequence is real and worth stating: the staff pool goes from four to
     *    FIVE, so the next generated roster distributes duties across five people
     *    rather than four. Rosters already stored are untouched — the migration
     *    copies and never rewrites — so this affects the next Generate, not history.
