// WHY IT LIVES IN `scripts/` AND NOT `src/`. `vitest.config.js` collects
// `src/**`, `functions/**` and `scripts/**/*.test.*`; this is not a `.test.` file
// because CI has no Firestore emulator and it would fail every build. The deps
// above are deliberately NOT in `package.json` — firebase-tools is ~685 packages
// and CI never needs them.
//
// It never contacts `idc-app-e0c59`: the project id is `demo-nexus-rules`, which the
// CLI treats as a demo project and refuses to let reach real services.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IT COVERS
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// ⚠️ SECTION 1 IS CROSS-TEAM ISOLATION AND IT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE. A member
//    of team A must get NOTHING from team B — roster, swaps, wellbeing, members,
//    loads, feed, the team's own name. Everything else in NEXUS protects a
//    department from its own mistakes; this protects one department from another,
//    and it is the property the whole multi-team rebuild exists to establish.
//
// Then: membership-as-data (the thing that replaced a hardcoded directory), the
// lead/member verb split, wellbeing ownership, the onboarding paths, the two public
// sinks, and a final section asserting the PRE-MIGRATION collections are sealed —
// the migration copies rather than moves, so those documents still exist and a
// stale path left in the app must not keep working.
//
// LAST RUN: 2026-09-24 against the Firestore emulator (firebase-tools 13) — 187 passed, 0 failed,
// after `community_assessments` was tightened. The same day 104 records captured from the
// real `recordTelemetry` (60 chat in four languages, 40 form, 4 result actions) were all
// accepted by the new rule.
// (Previous recorded run, 2026-08-21: 95 passed, 0 failed; the script has grown since — 15 of the 163 are the roster change-log block.)
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TRAPS PAID FOR ONCE, RECORDED SO THEY ARE NOT PAID FOR TWICE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 1. `changedKeys()` is `diff().affectedKeys()` — keys whose VALUE CHANGED, not
//    keys written. An early "cannot change two days in one write" case wrote `[]`
//    over an already-`[]` day, so only one key was affected and it passed in the
//    direction that would have hidden a real hole. Any new case must write
//    genuinely different values.
//
// 2. `c.firestore()` MUST BE CALLED ONCE PER CONTEXT. Calling it twice inside one
//    `withSecurityRulesDisabled` throws `failed-precondition: Firestore has already
//    been started` and crashes the run mid-way, which reads like a rules failure
//    rather than a harness one.
