 * COMMUNITY ACK — SPECIFICATION TEST SUITE
 * ==============================================================================
 * Runner: Vitest.  Run: npm test
 *
 * `communityAck` is the ONLY Cloud Function a member of the public can reach
 * without signing in. Everything below is attacker-controlled input, and every
 * case is a way the endpoint it replaced would have accepted it.
 *
 * The endpoint it replaced was `chatWithAura`, whose `validateChatInput` bounds
 * length and type and never content — which is how an unauthenticated caller came
 * to be able to supply 8,000 characters of system prompt to a model instructed
 * that it was a KKH/SingHealth database gateway.
