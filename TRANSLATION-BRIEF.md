# Translation brief — NEXUS Community (`CD10`)

**Written 2026-08-23** · the status table below is a snapshot of that date. **The live
status is `COMMUNITY_TODO.md`** (its status table row for `CP10`/`CD10`, and §7.7 for
group 1's provenance); when a group ships, update that file and then this one, not the
other way round. `CD13` — the native-speaker review of what has been machine-translated —
has its instrument at `docs/CD13-translation-review.xlsx` and has not been run.

The portal serves four languages, so each item needs **three** translations:
**Bahasa Melayu (`ms`)**, **中文 (`zh`)**, **தமிழ் (`ta`)**.

## Status (as of 2026-08-23)

| Group | What it is | State |
|---|---|---|
| **1** — the two new questions | 9 strings | ✅ **shipped**, machine-translated, **unreviewed** |
| **2** — in-chat action cards | 49 strings | ⬜ English only |
| **3** — the notices | 6 blocks | ⬜ English only |
| **4** — the printed handover slip | 24 strings | 🟡 **the 10 flag lines shipped**, bilingual; the other 14 English only |

## What changed about the position, and why

⚠️ **This file used to say "I have not machine-translated any of it, and I am not
going to." That is no longer true of Group 1, by the owner's decision, and the
reasoning is worth keeping rather than quietly overwriting.**

The original argument was that a paraphrase which reads fluently and shifts the
clinical meaning is worse than an English string, because nobody will notice it.
That argument still holds — and it is why Groups 2, 3 and 4 are still English only.
Group 2 in particular contains the URGENT tier: the text somebody reads immediately
after reporting chest pain.

Group 1 is different in kind, and the difference is not "it is less important":

- These are **questions**, not instructions. A question read slightly oddly is
  recoverable by the person answering it; *"call 995 if symptoms are severe"* read
  slightly oddly is not.
- The **status quo was already a failure**, not a safe default. `chatSteps.js` skips
  an untranslated question, so a Malay, Chinese or Tamil speaker was never asked
  about falls or Healthier SG at all — in the 60+ cohort the falls screen exists to
  protect, and among the less English-dominant residents an Active Ageing Centre
  referral targets. Every day it stayed English-only cost data that cannot be
  recovered later.
- The risk is **carried by a test, not by confidence**. See the Group 1 section: the
  danger turned out not to be the prose at all.

## The review debt

⚠️ **Everything shipped so far is machine-translated and unreviewed.** Two models
were involved and that is *not* a second opinion — neither can read back what it
wrote, so this is one debt covering both sets:

| Set | Strings | Translator |
|---|---|---|
| Group 1 — falls & Healthier SG chips and prompts | 9 × 3 | Claude |
| Group 4 — the ten reported-flag lines | 10 × 3 | Google Gemini 3.1 Pro |

A native speaker of each language should read the back-translations and confirm
**four** things. The rest is prose that can be corrected later; these change a value
or a clinical meaning:

1. `falls.chip1` cannot be read as *"I fell"* — it is the safest answer and it
   shares a stem with the riskiest one in every language.
2. `hsg.chip3` cannot be read as *"no"* — *"not sure"* must stay `null`, because
   `false` tells the person they are not enrolled with a Healthier SG GP.
3. `falls.chip4` conveys **avoiding activity out of fear**, not merely doing less.
4. On the printed slip, that each flag line reads as something a person would accept
   being said about them to a stranger. They are printed for a third party, so the
   register matters as much as the meaning.

**This is a ten-minute job for somebody who reads the language, and it is the only
thing between the current state and being able to say the portal is translated.**

## How to return the rest

Anything readable — a table, a spreadsheet, three columns in a message. Keep the
**IDs**; they are how each string finds its slot. Wiring each one in is a one-line
change and I will do it.

**Order of value, if you only get some of it done:** Group 2, then the rest of
Group 4, then Group 3.

---

## Group 1 — the two new questions · 9 strings · ✅ **SHIPPED, UNREVIEWED**

`src/data/screeningChips.js` (chips) and `src/components/AuraChat.jsx` (prompts).
All four languages now ask both questions. **Please review the back-translations
below** — they are machine translations and nobody who reads Tamil, Chinese or
Malay has checked them.

### ⚠️ What this group turned out to actually be

Translating these chips is **not** a text change, and the brief was wrong to imply
it was. `parseFallsAnswer` and `parseHealthierSg` match TOKEN LISTS in
`src/utils/clinicalFlags.js`, and those lists were English-only:

```
matchesNoFalls    = ['no falls', 'none', 'no']
matchesEnrolledNo = ['no', 'not enrolled']
```

`"Tiada jatuh"` matches nothing in the first, so the parser falls through to
`falls = 1, fallsRisk = true`. **Shipping the translations alone would have
recorded every Malay, Chinese and Tamil speaker who had never fallen as having
fallen** — scored for it, shown it on their result, and printed it on a handover
slip to a community centre as fact. Missing data would have become wrong data,
which is the exact trade the step-skip rule exists to refuse.

The matcher lists are extended, and `src/utils/clinicalFlags.i18n.test.js` (33
tests) asserts chip-for-chip parity: chip *n* in any language must parse to what
chip *n* in English parses to. Reverting the matchers to their English-only state
fails **12** of those tests, so it is load-bearing rather than decorative.

**Two phrasings are constrained by the parser, not by the language:**

- `falls.chip3` in Tamil reads *"இரண்டு முறை அல்லது அதிகமாக"* rather than the more
  natural *"இரண்டு அல்லது அதற்கு மேற்பட்ட"*. அல்லது ("or") begins with அல்ல, a
  Tamil negator; Tamil negation is postfix, so the parser read it as denying the
  "இரண்டு" beside it and the chip counted as **one** fall. Only the parity test saw
  this — the sentence is correct Tamil.
- `hsg.chip2` matches the enrolment verb in its negative form in each language
  (`tidak berdaftar`, `没有登记`, `செய்யவில்லை`) rather than the bare word for "no".
  Malay is why: *"Saya tidak pasti"* ("I am not sure") contains `tidak`, and
  `matchesEnrolledNo` is tested first — so a bare token would have turned *"the
  portal does not know"* into *"this person is not enrolled"*, silently, for every
  Malay speaker who was unsure. `CP26` separated those two values on purpose.

### The strings, with back-translations to check

**`falls.prompt`** — EN: *Two quick questions about steadiness. In the past 12
months, have you had a fall — including a slip or trip where you ended up on the
ground?*

|---|---|---|
| `ms` | Saya tidak pasti | I am not certain |
| `zh` | 我不确定 | I am not certain |
| `ta` | எனக்குத் தெரியவில்லை | I do not know |

**What a reviewer should check, in priority order:** that `falls.chip1` cannot be
read as *"I fell"*; that `hsg.chip3` cannot be read as *"no"*; that `falls.chip4`
conveys **avoiding activity out of fear** rather than merely doing less; and that
the two prompts read as questions a 70-year-old would answer rather than as forms.

## Group 3 — the notices · 4 blocks

Prose, not chips. Meaning matters more than length.

| ID | Where | English |
|---|---|---|
| `notice.beforeYouBegin` | `PathwaySelection.jsx` — shown **before** either pathway starts | *"This assessment records your answers — including age band, gender, ethnic group, housing type and the first two digits of your postal code — so that community health programmes can be planned for the areas that need them. It is de-identified at the point of capture: it does not collect or store your name, NRIC, contact details or financial information, and your postal sector is used only to map you to nearby services. Records are deleted automatically after 24 months. You will get your result either way."* |
| `notice.disclaimerTitle` | `ResultPage.jsx` | *"Important Medical Disclaimer"* |
| `notice.disclaimerBody` | `ResultPage.jsx` — directly under the Primary Action | *"This NEXUS AURA report is an initial community health navigation tool and does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or a treatment plan.

## Group 4 — the printed handover slip · 1 page

`src/components/HandoverSlip.jsx`. Printed and handed to a person at an Active
Ageing Centre or Social Service Office — so the reader may be a **staff member**
rather than the resident, and the register can be more formal than the app's.

⚠️ **The load-bearing sentence is `slip.notice`.** It is the reason the slip is
safe to hand over at all: NEXUS holds no name and no retrievable record, so a page
carrying a reference number and a risk band will be read as a referral unless this
says otherwise. It must stay unambiguous in translation — not softened, not
shortened.

| ID | English |
|---|---|
| `slip.title` | Community health summary |
| `slip.sub` | NEXUS · self-completed screening |
| `slip.notice` | **This is not a referral.** The person completed this screening themselves, on a public website. Nobody clinical has reviewed it, no appointment has been made, and NEXUS holds no record that can be looked up — the assessment is anonymous and stores no name, NRIC or contact details. Please treat it as what the person is telling you about themselves. |
| `slip.label.where` | Where |
| `slip.label.activity` | Activity |
| `slip.label.band` | Screening band |
| `slip.label.reported` | Reported |
| `slip.notProvided` | Not provided |
| `slip.nothingFlagged` | Nothing flagged |
| `slip.bandCaveat` | an internal banding, not a diagnosis |
| `slip.servicesHeading` | Services this points to |
| `slip.footDisclaimer` | **Not medical advice.** This summary does not constitute a diagnosis or a treatment plan. Anyone reporting chest pain, dizziness or any acute symptom should be directed to a GP or polyclinic, and to emergency care if symptoms are severe or sudden. |
| `slip.footRetention` | Not a referral · no record is held that can be retrieved · the anonymous assessment behind this page is deleted after 24 months. |
| `ui.printButton` | Print summary |

### ✅ The ten reported-flag lines — SHIPPED, bilingual

Supplied by the owner as a spreadsheet and wired into `src/data/slipFlagLines.js`.
These are the only strings in Group 4 that are done.

**⚠️ The slip is BILINGUAL rather than translated, and that is a reversal of how
every other surface in the portal works.** Each line prints English first with the
person's language beneath it. The reasoning is this file's own note, two sections
up: *"the reader may be a staff member rather than the resident"*.

- **Translated only** → handed across a counter at an Active Ageing Centre where
  the working language is English, and the receiving service cannot read the page.
  The document would be least usable exactly where it has to work, and the person
  carrying it would have no way to know.
- **English only** → these lines are assertions *about* the person — *"Psychological
  distress"*, *"Food insecurity reported"* — printed for a stranger to read. Somebody
  who cannot read them cannot check them, correct them, or decline to hand the page
  over. That is a dignity problem before it is a translation one.

English leads so the sheet stays fully readable to counter staff even when the
second line is a script they do not read.

**⚠️ It costs paper, measured rather than assumed.** In headless Chromium under
print emulation, A4 with 12mm margins and six services listed:

| flags | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| English only | 1pg | 1pg | 1pg | 1pg | 2pg |
| bilingual | 1pg | 1pg | **2pg** | 2pg | 2pg |

From six reported flags the slip runs to two sheets, where English-only reached
eight. Both pages carry real content — this is not the `CP21` defect, which was
seven *blank* pages — but somebody with six or more flags is the person most likely
to be handed one, and they now get two sheets. Taken deliberately.

**Provenance: Google Gemini 3.1 Pro**, via the owner. Machine translation, no
native-speaker review — the same state as Group 1, which is mine. See *The review
debt* below.

**One query, raised and settled — leave it as it is.** `fallsAvoiding.ta` ends
*"…செயல்பாடுகளைத் **தவிர்க்கிறது**"*: the third-person **neuter** verb ("it avoids")
where the honorific `தவிர்க்கிறார்` would be the expected form for describing a
person. The English is a participle with no explicit subject, so the compression may
be deliberate. **Owner's decision: kept.** Recorded here and in `slipFlagLines.js`
so it is not re-discovered and "fixed" by somebody who also cannot read Tamil.

### ⬜ Still English only, in this group

`slip.title`, `slip.sub`, `slip.notice`, the six `slip.label.*`, `slip.notProvided`,
`slip.nothingFlagged`, `slip.bandCaveat`, `slip.servicesHeading`,
`slip.footDisclaimer`, `slip.footRetention`, `ui.printButton`.

⚠️ **`slip.notice` is the load-bearing one and is deliberately still English.** It is
the sentence that stops the page being read as a referral, and under the bilingual
model above the receiving service is its primary reader — so English is where it has
to be correct first. A translation should be **added beneath** it, exactly like the
flag lines, not substituted for it.

## Group 5 — functional measures · 47 strings · ⚠️ **3 OF THEM GATE THE BUILD**

`src/data/measuresCopy.js`. Written 2026-09-12, machine-translated, on no screen
yet. This is the copy for the two strength measurements: grip strength in
kilograms, and how many times somebody can stand up from a chair.

### ⚠️ Why three of these are not like anything else in this brief

Everything in groups 1 to 4 is a question or an observation. A mistranslation there
collects a wrong answer or reads awkwardly, which is bad and recoverable.

**Three strings in this group are prohibitions.** Their entire job is to stop
somebody doing something, and that is the category the owner has already ruled on:
*"I have not machine-translated urgent clinical advice and will not."*

A prohibition degrades in a way nothing else in this brief does. *"Do not try this
on your own"* can come back as *"you may prefer to have someone with you"* and read
perfectly naturally, so a reviewer skimming for accuracy passes it. The sentence is
fine. The instruction is gone.

**So the one thing to check in this group is that each of the three is still an
instruction, not a suggestion.** Everything else is secondary.

These three are enforced in code, not by this document. `src/data/copyReview.js`
holds the registry and the build fails once a screen shows them. Today it does not,
so the build is green; it goes red the day the entry screen lands.

### The three that gate the build

**`measures.doNotSelfTest`** — EN: *Please do not try either test on your own now.
These are measured with someone there to help.*

⚠️ Must read as a **prohibition**. If the back-translation is a preference, a
recommendation, or anything with "should", it has failed and must be rewritten.

| | Translation | Back-translation |
|---|---|---|
| `ms` | Sila jangan cuba mana-mana ujian ini sendiri sekarang. Ujian ini diukur dengan ada orang di sisi untuk membantu. | Please do not try any of these tests by yourself now. These tests are measured with someone at your side to help. |
| `zh` | 请不要现在自己尝试这两项测试。这些测试要在有人在旁协助的情况下才进行测量。 | Please do not try these two tests by yourself now. These tests are only measured when there is someone alongside to assist. |
| `ta` | இந்த இரண்டு சோதனைகளையும் இப்போது நீங்களே தனியாக முயற்சிக்க வேண்டாம். உதவிக்கு ஒருவர் உடன் இருக்கும்போது மட்டுமே இவை அளக்கப்படுகின்றன. | Do not attempt these two tests by yourself alone now. These are measured only when someone is with you to help. |

**`measures.noComparison`** — EN: *We have kept your number so you can show it to
your doctor. We do not have a published range that covers your age, so we are not
going to guess one.*

⚠️ Must read as **we did not compare it**, not as a comparison that came out poorly.
A reader who takes this as a bad result is the failure this string exists to prevent.

| `ta` | உங்கள் மருத்துவரிடம் காட்டுவதற்காக உங்கள் எண்ணை நாங்கள் வைத்துள்ளோம். உங்கள் வயதை உள்ளடக்கிய வெளியிடப்பட்ட வரம்பு எங்களிடம் இல்லை, எனவே நாங்கள் ஊகிக்கப் போவதில்லை. | We have kept your number so that you can show it to your doctor. We do not have a published range that covers your age, so we are not going to guess. |

**`measures.notADiagnosis`** — EN: *These numbers describe your strength today. They
are not a diagnosis, and they have not changed your result above.*

⚠️ Must read as **not a diagnosis**. ⚠️ Tamil uses *நோய் கண்டறிதல்* ("disease
diagnosis"), which is more specific than the English. A Tamil reader should confirm
that is the right register for somebody who is not unwell.

### The other 44, read as a block

`measures.uiCopy` in the registry: two questions, the band labels, the nine reasons
a comparison was refused, the eight places a measurement is taken. Not gated, still
owed a read. Two things worth an eye:

- **The band labels never rank a person.** *"Below the usual range for your age"*,
  never *"weaker than most people your age"*. `measuresCopy.test.js` asserts this
  in English and the reviewer is the only check in the other three.
- **The chair stand has two levels, not three**, because the source publishes one
  cut-off. If a translation implies a middle level exists, it has invented one.

⚠️ **The back-translations above were produced by the same model that wrote the
translations.** That is not a second opinion and is not offered as one. They are
there so a reviewer can see what was intended, and the translation is what counts.

## Totals

| Group | Strings | × 3 languages |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — new questions | 9 | 27 |
| 2 — action cards | 49 | 147 |
| 3 — notices | 6 blocks | 18 |
| 4 — handover slip | 24 | 72 |
| 5 — functional measures | 47 | 141 |
| | **135** | **405** |

Group 2 is the bulk and the highest clinical stakes; Group 1 is the one where every
day it is missing costs data you cannot recover later. **Group 5 is the only one
that can stop a build**, and only three of its strings do: the three prohibitions.
Reading those three is roughly fifteen minutes per language, and it is the thing
standing between the functional measures feature and being shippable.
